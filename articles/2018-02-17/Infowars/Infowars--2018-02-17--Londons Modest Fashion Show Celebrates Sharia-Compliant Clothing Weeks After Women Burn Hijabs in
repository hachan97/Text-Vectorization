London Modest Fashion Week will celebrate Britains growing sharia-compliant fashion industry  less than two weeks after women living under Islamic fundamentalist regimes risked imprisonment when they burnt their hijabs on No Hijab Day.

Described as an exciting addition to the London fashion calendar and a celebration of style and global cultures, London Modest Fashion Week will showcase modest style lines on the catwalk this weekend.

The show will also put on a sharia legal clinic and zakat (religious tax) hub at the Victoria House, Bloomsbury Square, venue.

Organised by the Islamic clothing curator Haute Elan, the fashion websites founder Romanna Bint-Abubaker said in 2017: The fastest growing global consumer is at the moment the Muslim market.

One in three people by 2030 will be a Muslim in the world  thats a huge population.

Last years inaugural show was sponsored by the makeup brand Illamasqua which promised would never knowingly sell their products to supporters of U.S. President Donald J. Trump. This year, it is sponsored by the major American haircare brand TRESamme.

Labelling sharia-compliant clothing modest begs the question whether women who do not comply with Islamic fundamentalist rules  and are insufficiently covered  are deemed immodest.

Less than two weeks ago, social media was dominated by pictures and videos of women in Middle Eastern countries with strict legal dress codes burning their Islamic headscarves, or hijabs, accompanied by the hashtag #NoHijabDay.

The protests were in support of Iranian women demonstrating against the legally mandated headscarf that has been part of the Islamic Republics dress code since the countrys Islamic fundamentalist revolution in 1979.
