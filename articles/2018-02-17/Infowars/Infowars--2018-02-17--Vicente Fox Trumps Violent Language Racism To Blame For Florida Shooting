Former Mexican President Vicente Fox blamed the deadly mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on the violent, racist rhetoric stemming from the White House.

During an interview with HBOs Real Time host Bill Maher, Fox called Wednesdays shooting, which claimed 17 lives, a very sad event but what you get with President Trumps White House.

When you speak out of the White House this aggressive, violent language, when you discriminate, when youre a racist, thats what you get, the former Mexican president said Friday evening.
