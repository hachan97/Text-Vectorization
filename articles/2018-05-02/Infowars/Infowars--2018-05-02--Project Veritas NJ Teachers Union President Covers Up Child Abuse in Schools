Project Veritas released undercover footage showing Hamilton Township Education Association President David Perry explain how teacher unions prevent teachers who physically abuse children from being fired.

Im gonna strongly advise... [if] the kids gonna turn around and say Well [the teacher] threatened me.... I can say No. No no no. On March 22nd, the day after the incident, [the teacher] came over to me and told me [what happened.] And we just wanted to put it on record so that nothing more would come about it,' he told a PV operative.

We do turn [these reports] around to where, if it was a physical punch, it wasnt a punch. It was a shove. It covers [the teacher!] Because he came in and reported it right away and that he was afraid... but heres what happened. Everything else is bullsh*t.

I need to know the truth, so that we can bend the truth, he added.
