Special counsel Robert Mueller thus far hashed out four main topics he hopes to ask President Donald Trump about when they meet to discuss the Russian investigation, according to a CNN Wednesday report.

Investigators want to ask Trump about his role crafting a statement aboad Air Force One that miscast Donald Trump Jr.s June 2016 meeting with Russians at Trump Tower, the circumstances surrounding that meeting, and the firing of FBI Director James Comey and national security adviser Michael Flynn, the report noted. The findings are based on information from two anonymous sources. But the bulk of the topics surround the ousting of Comey and Flynn.

Trumps legal team  made up of attorney John Dowd and White House special counsel Ty Cobb  is discussing with Mueller a potential interview with the president potentially to include Attorney General Jeff Sessions involvement in Comeys firing as well as the Presidents knowledge of Flynns phone calls with the Russian ambassador.

Trump, who has frequently called the investigation into Russian meddling a witch hunt, sought to surround himself with a slew of high-end attorneys  he hired attorney Joe diGenova Monday and asked former Solicitor General Ted Olson to join his team. The president trudged through several months of allegations as Muellers investigation drags on.
