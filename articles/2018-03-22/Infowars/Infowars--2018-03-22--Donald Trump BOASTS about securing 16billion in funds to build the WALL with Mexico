A final version of a proposed $1.3trillion spending bill was agreed on Wednesday evening, with only a narrow 52-hour deadline before a government shutdown.

Trump has called for $1.6billion for 74 miles of border wall, with an extra $1.1billion for technology and other assets.

But instead, the omnibus bill gives $1.57 billion for barriers along the border but not for the new prototypes Trump had visited in California.

This did not stop the President taking to Twitter to boast, saying: Got $1.6billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forthcoming.

Most importantly, got $700billion to rebuild our Military, $716billion next year...most ever. Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment.

In another tweet, he added: Democrats refused to take care of DACA. Would have been so easy, but they just didnt care. I had to fight for Military and start of Wall.

The money would fund around 33 miles of new construction in the San Diego area and the repair of about 60 miles of existing segments.

Negotiators also rejected Trumps plans to hire hundreds of new Border Patrol and immigration enforcement agents.
