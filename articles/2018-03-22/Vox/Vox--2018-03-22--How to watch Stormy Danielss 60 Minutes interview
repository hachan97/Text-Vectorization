Stormy Daniels, the adult film actress who says she had an affair with Donald Trump in 2006 and is currently suing him, is speaking out. An interview with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, will be broadcast on CBSs 60 Minutes on Sunday, March 25. It will be Danielss first appearance on national television since the story of her alleged affair with Trump surfaced at the beginning of the year.

60 Minutes airs at 7 pm Eastern/Pacific on CBS stations and on the CBS digital streaming news service CBSN.

The interview, conducted by longtime host Anderson Cooper, actually occurred earlier this month, instigating loud calls for the network to televise the episode sooner. And its airing even though Trumps lawyer obtained a restraining order from an arbitrator that was meant to stop the interview from becoming public.

Daniels is suing Trump for the right to talk about their relationship. Shes currently bound by a nondisclosure agreement tied to a $130,000 payout. Trumps personal lawyer Michael Cohen said he paid Daniels with his own money without Trumps knowledge. (That payment could be a violation of campaign finance law  one reason the Daniels saga is more serious than it initially appeared.)

Daniels alleges the NDA is invalid because Donald Trump didnt sign it himself.

The story of the Trump-Daniels affairs first came to light on January 12 in a Wall Street Journal investigation. Since then, the details have become more salacious  and more troubling. Most recently, Danielss lawyer said threats of violence were used to keep his client quiet.
