House Republicans have released a new omnibus government spending bill, which must pass by Friday to avert another government shutdown in 2018.

The $1.3 trillion spending bill, which would fund the government through September 30, is the culmination of months of negotiations. Republicans and Democrats agreed on the budget levels back in February, when they passed their most recent short-term spending bill, but this weeks agreement would finalize the numbers for the remainder of the fiscal year.

The omnibus bill would increase domestic spending by $128 billion over the 2011 sequestration budget caps and increase military spending by $160 billion over the budget caps.

Congress looks likely to butt right up against its deadlines. The House isnt expected to vote on the spending deal until Thursday at the earliest, leaving just one more day for the Senate to act.
