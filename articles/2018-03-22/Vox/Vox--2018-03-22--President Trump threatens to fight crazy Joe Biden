Donald Trump is back in campaign mode  on Twitter, at least.

The second time Trump is referring to is that during the 2016 campaign, Biden said he would take Trump behind the gym for his comments, adding, What he said he did and does is the textbook definition of sexual assault.

Though he has not decided whether he will run for the White House in 2020, polling shows that Biden is currently the top choice for Democrats in New Hampshire, though he would turn 78 years old a few weeks after the election.

There are 957 days until Election Day 2020.

Correction: A previous version of this article misstated the number of days until Election Day 2020.
