The omnibus spending bill that Congress is preparing to pass, which would fund the federal government through September, has relatively modest changes for health care.

Initially, some senators were pushing for an Obamacare stabilization plan in the bill  but those proposals have been left out for now. The bill otherwise provides some modest funding boosts for medical research and the opioid crisis, while handing the drug industry a rare loss from Capitol Hill.

The final bill could still change  the sponsors of the Republican plan for the Obamacare markets want to add it when the bill comes to their side  but for now, this is whats in and whats out for health care in the spending bill.
