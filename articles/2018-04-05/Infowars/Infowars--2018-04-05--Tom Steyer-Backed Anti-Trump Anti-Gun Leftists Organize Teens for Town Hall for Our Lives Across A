On the heels of last months anti-gun, anti-Trump March for Our Lives adult-funded and backed protest by teen survivors of the Florida school shooting that killed 17 people at a Florida high school, another left-wing event is planned for Saturday.

The event is organized by the Town Hall Project website, started by former Hillary Clinton campaign staffer Jimmy Dahman last year. That entity is now connected with and promoting a teen-led series of meetings with members of Congress or candidates running against them over this week, culminating on Saturday with the Town Hall for Our Lives.

The website is backed and funded by a coalition of leftists, including Tom Steyers NextGen America, the Center for American Progress (CAP), Indivisible, and former President Barack Obamas Organizing for Action, among others.

The Sun Sentinel reported that Florida Reps. Ted Deutch, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and Frederica Wilson  all Democrats  will be attending a series of gun control forums this week in that state.
