Having presumably grown bored of inhaling condoms and ingesting tide pods, some millennials are now taking part in the latest social media craze  microwaving aluminum foil in an attempt to create a shiny ball.

The trend started after a video in which a Japanese YouTuber polishes a silver ball to make it extra reflective and shiny went viral.

Somehow this then mutated into a viral tweet which asked, Yall know this happened if you microwave foil for 3 minutes?

Despite being posted on April 1  April Fools Day  the tweet received over 38,000 retweets and over 62,000 likes.

Unaware of the basic fact that microwaving tin foil or aluminium is extremely dangerous and can cause serious fires, some people actually appeared to follow through and attempted the stunt.

While some of the claims may not be genuine (some of these are likely stock images), the sheer volume of people in the thread who said they would try the stunt undoubtedly means some of them went through with it.

Other Twitter users tried to bait idiots into microwaving aluminum by posting images of shiny balls as if they had just been taken out of the microwave.

While kids have always done stupid things, many of these people are adults.

With each passing day, we are moving closer towards Idiocracy.
