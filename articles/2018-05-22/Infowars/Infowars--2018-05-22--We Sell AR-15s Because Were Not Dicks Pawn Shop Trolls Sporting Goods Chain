A South Carolina pawn shop cleverly trolled Dicks Sporting Goods by hanging a banner in front of their store that reads, We Sell AR-15s Because Were Not Dicks.

The sign is a response to Dicks Sporting Goods decision to stop selling AR-15 rifles after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas school shooting.

The owners of Cross Roads Pawn and Auto in Little River, SC put the sign up last week and pawnbroker Brad Stamper said, It wasnt nothing negative or trying to promote violence or anything.

Store manager Barbara Davey told WPDE, We have a few people, you know, who werent in favor of the sign but our positive feedback really outweighed that negative feedback.

The store also released a statement regarding the sign.
