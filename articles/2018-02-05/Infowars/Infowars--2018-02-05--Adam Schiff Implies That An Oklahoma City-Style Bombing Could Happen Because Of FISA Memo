California Rep. Adam Schiff suggested that an Oklahoma City-style bombing could happen due to public trust in the FBI being reduced by the House Intelligence Committees memo released this week.

ABCs George Stephanopoulos said, You know, you talked about this strategy to discredit the Mueller investigation. Is it working?

Schiff responded by bringing up a hypothetical situation where a neighbor was buying lots of fertilizer, referencing the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.

Well, I dont think its working in the sense that people have a lot of confidence in Bob Mueller.

But it is impeaching the FBI, and the problem with this, and this is I think at the heart of the departments concernis if you have a neighbor whos buying fertilizer, lots of fertilizer, but has no yard and you have concerns about it and you want to call the FBI, youre now going to wonder Is that FBI going to hold my name in confidence or this information in confidence, what if this becomes politicized? Sources are going to dry up because of what the Republicans on this committee are doing now.

Theres a compact between our committee and the intelligence community. You give us your deepest held secrets, we will hold them in good confidence, we wont abuse them, theyre going to share a lot less with us now and other sources of information are going to decide not to share with the FBI because they cant rely on our committee not to be partisan in the handling of that information, and thats a deep disservice which ultimately makes the country less safe.
