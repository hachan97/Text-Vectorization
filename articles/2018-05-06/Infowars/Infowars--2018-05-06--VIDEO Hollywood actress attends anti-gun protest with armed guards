Do as Hollywood celebrities say, not as they do.

Actress Alyssa Milano attended an anti-NRA protest in downtown Dallas today  and she did it surrounded by armed guards.

In video captured by Ben Howe, NRA member Will Haraway asked Milanos security if he was armed and the man clearly wasnt amused by the question.

Im going to ask you to leave, the guard said repeatedly, physically backing Haraway up by getting in his face.

How far do I have to go? Haraway asked.

Im going to need you on the sidewalk, the agent responded.

Hypocrite! Alyssa youre a hypocrite! You have armed security here! an observer yelled.

Milanos friends, meanwhile, had no problem denouncing guns while benefiting from her special protected status.

I will change the world, Khary Penebaker declared, posing next to the safe Milano.

Not one more gun death. Not one more broken hearted family. NOT. ONE. MORE, he said.

The irony, of course, was lost on the Hollywood celebrity as she denounced the Second Amendment group.

The best way to defeat the NRA is to vote for candidates who dont take their money, she sniffed.

She wants the little people to disarm when she wont?
