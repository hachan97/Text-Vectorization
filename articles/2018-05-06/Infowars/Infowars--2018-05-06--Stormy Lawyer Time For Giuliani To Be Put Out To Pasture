Stormy Daniels lawyer Michael Avenatti charged Sunday that Rudy Giulianis television appearances have been an absolute unmitigated disaster for the president in a withering rebuke of Donald Trumps personal attorney.

In an interview on This Week, Avenatti said that Giulianis performance on the program just before him was an absolute train wreck and one of the worst TV appearances by an attorney acting on behalf of a client that he may have ever seen.

I mean this guys all over the map over the last 72 hours on some very simple facts that should be very straightforward, Avenatti said. They dont know what to say because theyve lost track of the truth.
