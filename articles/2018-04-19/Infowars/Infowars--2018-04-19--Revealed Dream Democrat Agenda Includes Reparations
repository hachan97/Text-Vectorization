A wealthy Democratic donor club plotting the future of the liberal movement hopes to be fighting for reparations by 2022, according to a document obtained by the Washington Free Beacon from the Democracy Alliances fall conference this week in Atlanta.

The desire was stated in the invitation for a Monday reception during the biannual conference, which was attended by top Democratic Party officials such as DNC chairman Tom Perez, former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, and Reps. Raul Grijalva (Ariz.) and Mark Pocan (Wis.).

The reception, Way to Win: 2022 Victory Party, was presented as a look forward at whats possible if Democrats can be effective in coming elections.

Its 2022 and we are celebrating policy victories across the nation: Medicare for All and Free College, and next on the agenda is Reparations, the group projected, according to an invitation to the event.
