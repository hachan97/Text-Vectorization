If the Trumps were Democrats, conservative actor James Woods tweeted earlier this month, Melania would be on every cover of every chic womens magazine in the world every month.

Woods may be exaggerating a little bit  only Oprah can put herself on the cover of a magazine every month, and its her own magazine  but he does make an interesting point. First Lady Melania Trump has not graced the cover of a single magazine in the United States since her husband took office over a year ago. Michelle Obama, on the other hand, was featured on at least thirty magazine covers during her husbands eight years in office. What gives?

Michelle Obama: The First Lady The Worlds Been Waiting For, reads the March 2009 cover of Vogue. Michelle Obama Looks Back On Her Big Year  And Answers Your Questions, proclaims the December 2009 cover of Glamour. Michelle Obama, How The First Lady And The President Are Inspiring America, Vogue again, April 2013. But Melania Trump? Crickets.

So heres my question: where are all the feminists? It seems to me that the reason Melania hasnt been on any magazine covers isnt just that her husband is a Republican. Laura Bush was on plenty of magazine covers while her husband was president, as was Nancy Reagan. No, Melania hasnt been on any magazine covers because people think shes not worth covering. That shes just Trumps ex-model trophy wife  not really first lady material. But shouldnt that be the cue for some screaming harpy to descend and explain, in Screaming Harpese, how sexist that is?
