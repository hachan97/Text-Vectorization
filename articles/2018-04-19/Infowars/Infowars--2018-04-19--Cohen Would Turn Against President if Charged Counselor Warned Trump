One of President Donald Trumps longtime legal advisers said he warned the president in a phone call Friday that Michael Cohen, Mr. Trumps personal lawyer and close friend, would turn against the president and cooperate with federal prosecutors if faced with criminal charges.

Mr. Trump made the call seeking advice from Jay Goldberg, who represented Mr. Trump in the 1990s and early 2000s.

Mr. Goldberg said he cautioned the president not to trust Mr. Cohen.
