"I even told him a day or two ago I saw where this was going," Trump told Fox News' "Fox & Friends" over the phone, later adding that "it's a disgrace."

The President also said all the allegations against Jackson were false, saying the White House physician's opponents are "trying to destroy a man."

In a statement, Jackson called the allegations against him as "false" but said they had become a distraction for Trump and veterans' interests.

Trump on "Fox & Friends" directed his ire over Jackson's withdrawal at Montana Sen. Jon Tester, the leading Democrat on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. Tester discussed the allegations against Jackson this week. Trump said he thinks Tester will have a "big price to pay in Montana," adding, "I think this is going to cause him a lot of problems in his state."
