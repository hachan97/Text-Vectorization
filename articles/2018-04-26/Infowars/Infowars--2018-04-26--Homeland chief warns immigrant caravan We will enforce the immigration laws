Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Wednesday warned that the federal government is prepared to prosecute Central American migrants from a caravan planning to cross the U.S. border this weekend.

Nielsen said in a statement that the Homeland Security Department is monitoring the caravans movements, and is doing everything within our authorities to secure our borders and enforce the law.

Let me be clear: We will enforce the immigration laws as set forth by Congress, she said.

If you enter our country illegally, you have broken the law and will be referred for prosecution. If you make a false immigration claim, you have broken the law and will be referred for prosecution. If you assist or coach an individual in making a false immigration claim, you have broken the law and will be referred for prosecution.
