Five men accused of gang-raping an 18-year-old woman in Spain have each been sentenced to nine years in jail, in a high-profile case that sparked outrage.

The men, in their late 20s, were found guilty of sexual abuse but acquitted of the more serious crime of rape.

The five can appeal. They filmed their attack during Pamplona's San Fermin bull-running festival in July 2016.

Dozens of protesters outside the court criticised the verdict, shouting "It's rape, not abuse".

After the attack, one of the men posted messages in a WhatsApp group celebrating what they had done and promising to share videos. They have been held in custody since July 2016.

Videos of the late-night encounter between the men and the young woman from Madrid showed how the five men had wandered the streets among other drunken revellers before two of them led her into the basement block of flats by the hand.

According to a police report, the men - who belonged to a WhatsApp group called "La manada" (wolf pack) - surrounded the woman in a small alcove, removed her clothes and had unprotected sex.

Some of them filmed the sexual act on their phones - there were seven videos, totalling 96 seconds.

The alleged victim maintained a "passive or neutral" attitude throughout the scene, keeping her eyes closed at all times, the police report said.

The woman was found in a reportedly distraught state by a couple in the street outside the scene of the attack. She told the trial she was still having psychological treatment to deal with trauma.

Some of the men were found to be in a video in which they apparently abuse another woman, who seemed to be unconscious.
