Dreamer Hilario Yanez praised President Donald Trumps leadership on immigration and slammed Democrats for using DACA recipients as pawns during a Saturday interview on Fox News.

At the end of the day, heres a guy who wants to provide a pathway to citizenship for myself and, you know, really make a difference in my life, Yanez said of President Trump. Im for that. Also, I believe we need to have border security so this doesnt happen again.

And if a wall is necessary to provide another layer for border security to do their job in a safe and responsible manner, then, you know, I think its necessary to fund it, he continued.
