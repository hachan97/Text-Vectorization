Need more evidence that there are two Americas? Here: Left-wing hatred of Melania Trump is inversely proportional to flyover admiration for the first lady.

In just the last month, late-night clown Jimmy Kimmel mocked Trumps Slovenian accent, CNN contributor April Ryan attacked her as not culturally American, former Hillary Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines derided her genteel presence at former President George H.W. Bushs funeral, and horror writer Stephen King snickered at her hospitalization this week for kidney surgery.

Yet, while partisans in the political press and entertainment media work hard to stoke division against and resentment of the Trump administration, Melania is now among the fastest-growing baby names in the nation, according to recently released Social Security data.
