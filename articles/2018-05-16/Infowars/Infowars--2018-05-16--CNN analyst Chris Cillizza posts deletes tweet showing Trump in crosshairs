A political analyst with CNN came under fire Tuesday after tweeting out a graphic depicting President Trump in crosshairs.

The commentator, Chris Cillizza, tweeted out a GIF with the visual just before 9 a.m., along with the caption Donald Trump, pointing to heavens to commemorate police officers killed in the line of duty.

He quickly deleted the tweet  but not before Twitter users were able to grab some screenshots.

Cillizza explained later that the image was unintentional, the result of a default setting in a program hed used to generate the graphic.
