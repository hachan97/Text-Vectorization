Theres a lot Donald Trump Jr. cant remember about the 2016 election and after, including what he meant by, If its what you say I love it, in response to an email offering dirt on Hillary Clinton and whether hes discussed the Russia investigation with his father. Thats according to a transcript released Wednesday by the Senate Judiciary Committee of Trumps interview with the committee discussing the now-infamous Trump Tower meeting in June 2016.

The committee released more than 1,800 pages of transcripts of interviews with President Trumps eldest son and others who attended the June 9 meeting in Manhattan. Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort were among those who took part in the gathering arranged by publicist Rob Goldstone, who promised that Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya had incriminating information about Clinton.

The Trump team initially tried to cover up the meeting when reports of it emerged in the summer of 2017, offering conflicting stories about its purpose and what happened. Trump Jr. tweeted out the full email chain of his communications setting up the meeting to preempt a New York Times story about it in July. The meeting is under scrutiny as part of special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Wednesdays 200-plus-page transcript provides insight into Trump Jr.s explanation of the meeting and what happened after, including his response to the email offering Russian-linked dirt on Clinton: If its what you say I love it especially later in the summer. His explanation to the Senate Judiciary Committee? It was just a thanks. It was a colloquial term to say hey, great, thank you.
