President Donald Trump appears to be laying the groundwork for firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller by accusing James Comey of illegally leaking classified information.

Trump tweeted late Friday: James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council[sic]?

Therefore, the Special Council [sic] was established based on an illegal act? Really, does everybody know what that means?

Trump was most likely referring to a report in The Wall Street Journal on Friday about a review of Comeys memos by the Department of Justices internal watchdog.

Two of the memos that Comey wrote and then gave to a friend from outside of the government contained classified information, according to the Journal.
