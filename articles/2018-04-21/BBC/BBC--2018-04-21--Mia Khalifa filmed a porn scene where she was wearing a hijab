Former porn star Mia Khalifa has said she received death threats from so-called Islamic State after she filmed a porn scene wearing a hijab.

Khalifa, who was raised as Catholic by Lebanese parents, said the idea to wear the hijab came from the film producers.

Speaking to BBC Radio 5 lives Inzy Rashid and Calum MacDonald, she said death threats came within a week of the film being published online.

Khalifa spent just three months working in the porn industry before leaving in 2015.
