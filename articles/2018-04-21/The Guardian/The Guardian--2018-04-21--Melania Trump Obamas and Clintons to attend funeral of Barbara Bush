Some 1,500 guests are expected to attend the largest Episcopal church in the US on Saturday, for the private funeral of Barbara Bush. The wife of the 41st president, George HW Bush, and mother of the 43rd, George W Bush, died on Tuesday at her Houston home. She was 92.

First lady Melania Trump, former president Bill Clinton, former secretary of state and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and former president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle are among those expected to attend the service at St Martins Episcopal Church in Houston.

President Donald Trump, a fierce critic of the Bush family during the 2016 election, will not attend. The White House said this week that Trump would not attend to avoid disruptions due to added security, and out of respect for the Bush family and friends attending the service.

The New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, whom Trump attacked on Saturday, tweeted that having [the president] there was not something the Bushes wanted.

In a statement released on Friday, the family said Barbara Bush had selected her son Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor who ran against Trump for the Republican nomination, to deliver a eulogy. Also speaking will be her long-time friend Susan Baker, wife of former secretary of state James Baker, and historian Jon Meacham, who wrote a biography of her husband, George HW Bush.

Burial will be at the Bush Library at Texas A&M University, about 100 miles north-west of the city. The burial site is in a gated plot surrounded by trees and near a creek where Barbara Bushs daughter, Robin, is buried. She died of leukemia in 1953, aged three. 



Only one other woman has been married to one president and the mother of another. That was Abigail Adams, wife of the second president, John Adams, and mother of the sixth, John Quincy Adams.
