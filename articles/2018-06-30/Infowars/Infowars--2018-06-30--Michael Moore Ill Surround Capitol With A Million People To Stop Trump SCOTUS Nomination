Michael Moore on Friday said he would rally on Capitol Hill with a million others to keep lawmakers from confirming President Trumps pick to succeed outgoing Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy.

Appearing on HBOs Real Time with Bill Maher, the liberal filmmaker and activist said hed participate in a wide-scale protest to prevent the Senate from approving the presidents second Supreme Court nominee, assuming Republican leadership schedules a vote before the November midterm elections when Democrats risk gaining control.

Weve got to hold the Democratic seats we have, but look, 90 percent of incumbents are always returned, Mr. Moore. The Democrats in Montana and North Dakota, West Virginia, theyve got to do their job, theyll do their job. Our job is to win Nevada, Arizona and Tennessee and they could all be won!
