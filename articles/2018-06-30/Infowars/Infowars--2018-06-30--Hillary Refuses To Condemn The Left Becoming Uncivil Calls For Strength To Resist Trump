Failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton rejected calls of civility in a recent interview, calling for strength and resolve to resist President Trump.

The Guardian reports that when asked about some on the left becoming uncivil recently, she responded:

Oh, give me a break, she erupts, eyes widening into indignation. Give me a break! What is more uncivil and cruel than taking children away? It should be met with resolve and strength. And if some of that comes across as a little uncivil, well, childrens lives are at stake; their futures are at stake. That is that ridiculous concept of bothsideism.

Clinton also mocked people who call for civility in political discourse, imitating, Well, you know, somebody made an insulting, profane remark about President Trump, and he separated 2,300 children from their families, thats both sides, and we should stop being uncivil  oh, and, by the way, he should stop separating children.

Give me a break, really, she growls, rolling her eyes, The Guardian article also reported her saying.
