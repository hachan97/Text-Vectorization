Paul Sperry reports at RealClearInvestigations  the investigative reporting affiliate of trusted polling aggregator RealClearPolitics  that the FBI is refusing to allow members of Congress to review intelligence that alleges Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch interfered in the Hillary Clinton email investigation:

The FBI had little problem leaking unverified dirt from Russian sources on Donald Trump and his campaign aides  and even basing FISA wiretaps on it. But according to the Justice Departments inspector general, the bureau is refusing to allow even members of Congress with top security clearance to see intercepted material alleging political interference by President Obamas attorney general, Loretta Lynch.

That material  which has been outlined in press reports  consists of unverified accounts intercepted from putative Russian sources in which the head of the Democratic National Committee allegedly implicates the Hillary Clinton campaign and Lynch in a secret deal to fix the Clinton email investigation.

It is remarkable how this Justice Department is protecting the corruption of the Obama Justice Department, said Tom Fitton, president of Washington-based watchdog Judicial Watch, which is suing for the material.
