Street artist Sabo and his Unsavory Agents placed Nazi-style propaganda posters around Los Angeles this week in an effort to bring attention to growing anti-conservative rhetoric being promoted by the left.

One poster declares Republicans Are Forbidden, in both German and English and another orders Dems to Buy Only At Democrat Shops.

Sabo gave a statement to Daily Wire Wednesday, saying the project was inspired by the Red Hen restaurants treatment of Sarah Sanders last week and admitting it sent a chill through him.

It seems the Democrat owners dont welcome the patronage of Republicans, he said.

Recently while visiting Austin, Texas me and my party were asked to leave no less than three bars because one of us dared wear a MAGA hat.

Sabo continued, We were told that our kind werent welcomed there. What the hell kind is that I wondered. Patriots, Republicans, Americans? It really freaked me out.

The prolific street artist says he created the signs to remind people that this has happened before and that we should learn from the past.
