A federal judge released an illegal alien who has now disappeared after being taken into custody for allegedly ramming a car into a daycare center, causing serious injuries to a teacher.

Juana Loa-Nunez was arrested on May 7 after she allegedly crashed her car into an Indiana church daycare center and then fled the scene, WTHR Channel 13 reported.

One teacher, Jessica Parks, was hit during the accident and suffered a broken leg and other injuries.

Loa-Nunez is reportedly an illegal alien who has no drivers license. She was arrested by the Marion County Sheriffs Department, but by Friday, authorities released the suspect from jail without notifying U.S. immigration officials. The suspect has since disappeared, authorities said.

The sheriffs department was severely criticized by Ricardo Wong, head of the ICE Chicago field office, who called the release brazen.
