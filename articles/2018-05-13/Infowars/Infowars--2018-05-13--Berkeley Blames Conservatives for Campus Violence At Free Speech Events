The University of California Berkeley has conducted an investigation of problems related to free speech on campus  particularly surrounding events where conservatives (or even insufficiently left-wing progressives) are invited to speak on campus and met with violence and disruption by left-wing activists.

Bizarrely, the report of the Commission on Free Speech concludes that conservatives, not the left, are to blame for the violence on campus.

In one passage, the report states: [O]ur conclusion is that the rise of ultra-conservative rhetoric, including white supremacist views and protest marches, legitimized by the 2016 presidential election and its aftermath, encouraged far-right and alt-right activists to spike the football at Berkeley.

It insists: Contrary to a currently popular narrative, Berkeley remains a tolerant campus.
