Staffers and allies of President Donald Trump face a new normal in todays heated political environment: the potential for harassment and protests anywhere they show their faces  both in their public and private lives.

Democratic California Rep. Maxine Waters shocked political observers over the weekend by encouraging liberal mobs to harass Trump officials at restaurants, gas stations and even at home.

Already you have members of your cabinet that are being booed out of restaurants, We have protesters taking up at their house who are saying, No peace, no sleep. No peace, no sleep, Waters told a liberal crowd on Saturday, pledging to win this battle.

If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd, the congresswoman added. And you push back on them. Tell them theyre not welcome any more, anywhere!
