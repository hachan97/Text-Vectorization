As Townhall previously reported, a CBS poll released today showed that more Americans than not want illegal alien families either detained or deported all together. But, that same poll shows that 51% of Americans believe that a wall along the United States southern border is a good thing, even if that structure does not span coast-to-coast.

According to the poll, 32% of Americans believe that a wall along the U.S. Mexican border is a good idea that can probably be completed. 19% of those polled answered that the wall is a a good idea that should be tried, even if it cannot be completed. 48% of the 2063 adults polled said the wall was a bad idea.

The CBS poll was conducted last week from June 21-June 22. The poll comes after nearly two weeks of intense national scrutiny of the Trump administration regarding its handling of the southern border child migrant crisis. Democratic officials, liberals, and moderate Republicans have blasted President Trump for his zero tolerance policy of separately detaining illegal alien children from their parents when caught crossing the Mexican-American border.
