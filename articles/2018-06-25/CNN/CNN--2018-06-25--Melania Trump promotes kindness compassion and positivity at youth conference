Trump came under fire last week when she wore a jacket emblazoned with the words "I really don't care. Do u?" on her way to an unannounced border facility visit in Texas. It's unclear who her message was intended to reach, her spokeswoman tweeting "#ItsJustAJacket" while the President tweeted that the message was aimed at the media.

Trump, who met with SADD student leaders before her speech, told the group that youth leadership programs like SADD "can be such a positive influence for the future." SADD was founded as "Students Against Driving Drunk" in 1981. The organization broadened its mission in 1997, and is now committed to "(highlighting) prevention of all destructive behaviors and attitudes that are harmful to young people," per its website.
