This one has Democrat deception written all over it  but the backlash is already brutal.

The largest and most popular supermarket chain in Florida is suspending its political contributions just as the Sunshine States governors race starts to heat up, thanks to some highly publicized anti-gun demonstrations by the poster boy for gun grabbers everywhere.

And the target just happens to be one of the GOPs top contenders for the states top job.

According to the Orlando Sentinel, Publix announced the suspension Friday, shortly before die-in protests took place at two of its Florida locations organized by David Hogg, the teenager who is riding Februarys mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, to a mountain of undeserved personal publicity.
