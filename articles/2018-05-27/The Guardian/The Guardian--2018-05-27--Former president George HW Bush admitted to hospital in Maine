Former president George HW Bush was taken to a hospital in Maine on Sunday after experiencing low blood pressure and fatigue, a family spokesman said.

Bush, 93 and the oldest living former US president, will likely remain at Southern Maine Health Care for a few days for observation, said the spokesman.

The former president is awake and alert, and not in any discomfort, Jim McGrath wrote on Twitter.

Bushs wife, Barbara Bush, died in April at the age of 92. The couple had been married for 73 years.

Bush, his son former president George W Bush and Democratic former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama attended the funeral in Houston. Former president Jimmy Carter and current president Donald Trump did not.

George HW Bush was hospitalised after the funeral, for 13 days because of a blood infection.

On Saturday, Bush attended an American Legion event in Kennebunkport, Maine, to mark Memorial Day weekend with veterans and his former national security adviser Brent Scowcroft.
