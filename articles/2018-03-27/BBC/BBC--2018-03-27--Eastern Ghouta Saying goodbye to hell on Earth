Thousands of Syrian rebel fighters and civilians are being bussed from Eastern Ghouta after two rebel groups reached a withdrawal deal with the Syrian government.

The enclave is close to the capital, Damascus, and residents  who have lived under siege for five years  have suffered intense bombardment by Russian-backed Syrian government forces in recent weeks.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres described conditions there as "hell on Earth".
