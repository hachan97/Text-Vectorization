A sociologist on MSNBC threw cold water on all the medias claims that the March For Our Lives protests were spontaneous and led by the nations children during a Morning Joe segment on Monday.

University of Maryland sociologist Dana Fisher conducted a study of the demographics of Saturdays march in Washington, D.C., and discovered that only less than 10 percent of those in the crowd were under the age of 18.

While Fisher tried to make it sound like these individuals were all potential voters, it is likely that many of those who showed up were simply run-of-the-mill liberal activists.

The study was done by going through the crowds with tablets and conducting surveys of participants and then extrapolating trends from the data collected, according to Fisher.
