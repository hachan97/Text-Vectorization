The half-brother of Rev. Al Sharpton, also an activist whose group participated in Saturdays anti-gun March For Our Lives, has been charged in a Sunday shooting death in Dothan, Ala.

Dothan police said that Rev. Kenneth Glasgow was the driver in a car linked to the murder of 23-year-old Breunia Jennings of Dothan by passenger Jamie Townes, 26.

Dothan Police Chief Steve Parrish said that Glasgow and Townes allegedly searched for Jennings, who they believe had stolen Townes car. When they found her, Townes allegedly shot Jennings as she drove, hitting her in the head. She died later.
