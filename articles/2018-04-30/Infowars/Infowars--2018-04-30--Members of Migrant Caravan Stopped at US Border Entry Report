A group of Central American migrants traveling to the United States was blocked at an inspection facility and prevented from crossing the border from Mexico, The Associated Press reported.

Appriximately 50 members made it past Mexican officials and traversed a bridge on Sunday, but were not allowed inside the U.S. inspection site and remained outside the building, the AP said.

The development comes after the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said Sunday that the crossing was at capacity.

As sufficient space and resources become available, CBP officers will be able to take additional individuals into the port for processing, McAleenan said in a statement.
