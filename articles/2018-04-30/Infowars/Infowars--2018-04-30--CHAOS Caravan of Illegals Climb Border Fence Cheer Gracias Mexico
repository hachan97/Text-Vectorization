The caravan of illegal aliens is now trying to bum-rush the U.S. border.

Video coming out of Tijuana, Mexico shows illegals scaling the fence in an attempt to enter the United States.

Amidst the chaos, migrants can be heard cheering, Gracias, Mexico! after the country did nothing to stop the illegal aliens from passing through the country and towards the U.S.

Meanwhile, the Border Patrol says the San is Ysidro port is at capacity and unable to process any additional migrants seeking entry into America.
