President Trump on Sunday joined in on the criticism of comedian Michelle Wolfs performance at this years White House Correspondents Association (WHCA) dinner, calling her filthy and slamming the event as an embarrassment.

The White House Correspondents Dinner was a failure last year, but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it, Trump tweeted.

The filthy comedian totally bombed (couldnt even deliver her lines-much like the Seth Meyers weak performance). Put Dinner to rest, or start over! he added, referencing Meyers 2011 headlining performance in which he roasted Trump.
