CHERRY HILL  The principal of Cherry Hill High School East has apologized for insensitive language on tickets for the upcoming senior prom.

The tickets urged students to party like its 1776 during the event at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.

But that prompted complaints from students who noted not all communities can celebrate what life was like in 1776, Principal Dennis Perry said in a letter to the community Friday.

I am writing to apologize for the hurt feelings this reference caused for members of our school family, wrote Perry.

I especially apologize to our African American students, who I have let down by not initially recognizing the inappropriateness of this wording, he added.

Perry said all prom-goers will receive commemorative tickets without the offensive language and vowed the school will make changes to produce well thought out, appropriate communications.
