Comedian and progressive talk show host Bill Maher defended Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham on Friday, arguing with guests on his HBO show that a boycott led by Parkland, Fla., school shooting survivor David Hogg was un-American.

Maher sparred with Real Time panel guests including author Max Boot over whether Hoggs boycott of Ingraham, who Maher admitted is a deliberately terrible person, should be celebrated.

Hogg called for his Twitter followers to contact Ingrahams top advertisers following her criticism of him last month. Ingrahams Fox News show has since been dropped by multiple companies.
