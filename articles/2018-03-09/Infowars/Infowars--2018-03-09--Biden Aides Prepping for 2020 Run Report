Former Vice President Joe Biden is moving closer to a 2020 run for president, with close aides telling Politico that they are preparing for a number of scenarios ahead of a possible campaign announcement.

Politico reports that a close circle of Biden aides is preparing for several 2020 scenarios, including Biden announcing his candidacy early enough to set the field of challengers around him or late enough to skip the first two contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. Another option could reportedly be running on the promise of a one-term presidency.

The former vice president is thinking through a million unconventional options, because there is an acknowledgment that this could be an unconventional campaign, one person close to the discussions said.
