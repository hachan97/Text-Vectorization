President Trump issued the second pardon of his presidency Friday to former Navy sailor Kristian Saucier.

Saucier was sentenced to a year in prison during the 2016 campaign for taking pictures inside a nuclear submarine. Trump invoked his case repeatedly on the campaign trail, saying he was ruined for doing nothing compared to Hillary Clinton. Saucier was 22 years old when he took the cellphone photos in 2009.

The photos Saucier, now 31, took inside the sub were deemed confidential, meaning the lowest level of classification, even though some depicted the vessels nuclear reactor. Clinton, by contrast, sent and received more highly classified information on a private and insecure email server.
