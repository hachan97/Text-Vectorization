The neighbor of Kentucky Senator Rand Paul pleaded guilty to attacking Paul.

Rene Boucher pleaded guilty to assaulting the Senator resulting in personal injury, a felony under federal law.

Boucher tackled Paul in November while he was mowing his lawn, causing multiple fractured ribs and he subsequently contracted and required medical attention for pneumonia.

Boucher admitted the assault but denied it was politically motivated and said it was a dispute between neighbors.
