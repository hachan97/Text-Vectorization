The national media are scaling back their prediction for a Democratic blue wave in the 2018 midterms, in light of a new poll that shows some Democrats are vulnerable and a healthy GOP turnout in Texas this week.

Fueled in part by Republican-backed tax cuts that increased the paychecks for most people, Republicans and President Trump have seen their own poll numbers rise, and what was previously viewed as a coming reckoning by Democrats has stalled.

The website Axios on Thursday published a poll that showed big warning signs for Senate Democrats. It noted that in 10 states where Democrats are defending Senate seats, a Republican opponent polls either ahead or close to the Democrat in five of those states (though in most of the races, the GOP has not chosen its nominee yet).

The poll also showed that in most states, Trumps approval rating is 50 percent or higher, which could be a sign that he will not have a negative impact on those state races.
