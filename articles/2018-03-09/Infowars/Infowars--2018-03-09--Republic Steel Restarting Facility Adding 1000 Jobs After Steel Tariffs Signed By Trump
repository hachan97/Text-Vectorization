In response to President Trump signing proclamations Thursday imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, Republic Steel has announced plans to restart its Lorain facility.

The move would bring back more than 1,000 jobs to the Lorain plant, which will be positioned to restart its idled electric arc furnace, casters, and rolling mills on short notice.

Republic currently has open capacity at its Canton melt shop. Restarting the Lorain facility would provide more than a million tons of new production capacity. The company anticipates tht it would take a few months to hire and train employees and restart its idled equipment.
