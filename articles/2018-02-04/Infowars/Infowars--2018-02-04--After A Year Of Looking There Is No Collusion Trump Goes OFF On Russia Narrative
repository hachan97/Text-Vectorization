President Trump sent a series of fiery tweets Saturday following the release of the House Intelligence Committee memo purporting to show FBI surveillance abuse.

Unemployment in the United States also dropped to its lowest percentage in 17 years under President Trump.

Trump also tweeted out lines from an opinion piece published by the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board Friday titled A Reckoning for the FBI.

These tweets come after Trump also tweeted this morning, saying collusion is dead, and calling the Russian Witch Hunt an American disgrace.
