National Rifle Association spokeswoman Dana Loesch blamed the media for creating the monsters who commit mass shootings like the one at a Texas high school on Friday.

The media has got to stop creating more of these monsters by oversaturation, Loesch said on NRATV Friday, just hours after a deadly shooting at Santa Fe High School claimed 10 lives.

Im not saying dont responsibly report on things as they happen, she continued. Look, I understand it. But constantly showing the image of the murderer, constantly saying their name is completely unnecessary.
