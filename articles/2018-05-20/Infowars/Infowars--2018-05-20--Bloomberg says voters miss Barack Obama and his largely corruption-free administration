First things first: Albert R. Hunts piece in Bloomberg this week is clearly labeled an opinion piece, but obviously one that Bloomberg felt was compelling enough to publish.

Hunt kicks off his piece with a CNN poll that shows most Americans think Barack Obama was a better president than Donald Trump has been. Its not policy, though, that accounts for the result; to Hunt, it all boils down to one word: integrity.

The explanation seems simpler: a respect for integrity, Hunt writes. Obama had it, running a largely corruption-free administration. The Trump presidency, all 16 months of it, has been marked by lies, greed, ethical transgressions and criminal charges.

First, we always get a kick of out the retrospective claims that Obamas administration was scandal-free, and second  isnt this the guy who won Politifacts Lie of the Year honor in 2013 for his claim that If you like your plan, you can keep it? And then there was Fast & Furious, spying on Fox News James Rosen, pallets of cash to Iran ... wait, lets leave some for others.
