Cant say this enough.

Honestly, there is so much noise out in the media about investigations, Russia, Trump, collusion, has-been porn stars with ambulance-chasing attorneys ... its hard for us crazy people with Twitchy to keep up with it, let alone people who dont read this chaos every day for a living.

And you wonder why were all slowly losing our minds.

Anyway, Sharyl laid out a timeline about collusion AGAINST Trump and just wow.

 Anti-Russian Ukrainians allegedly helped coordinate and execute a campaign against Trump in partnership with the Democratic National Committee and news reporters.

  A Yemen-born ex-British spy reportedly delivered political opposition research against Trump to reporters, Sen. John McCain, and the FBI; the latter of which used the materialin partto obtain wiretaps against one or more Trump-related associates.

  There were orchestrated leaks of anti-Trump information and allegations to the press, including by ex-FBI Director James Comey.
