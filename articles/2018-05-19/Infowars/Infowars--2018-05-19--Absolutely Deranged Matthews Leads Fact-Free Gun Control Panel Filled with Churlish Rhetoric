Despite the fact that Fridays alleged gunman in the despicable high school shooting in Santa Fe, TX used his fathers shotgun and .38 caliber revolver, MSNBCs Hardball host Chris Matthews shepherded through a discourteous opening panel of Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro (TX), Moms Demand Action leader Shannon Watts, and Parkland, FL teacher Greg Pittman that showed an inability to grasp facts but rather an ability to hurl insults.

Matthews set the tone in his opening, declaring Santa Fe to be another chapter in a common story now in America as is the absence of action by the countrys leaders as there was intermittent gunfire across the country, [but] political silence here in the Capital.

He and Castro briefly sought common ground with pro-Second Amendment supporters by stating the need for parents to be more responsible in storing their firearms so as to keep them away from children, but leave it to Matthews having Watts to get him whipped into a frenzy.

Matthews teed her up by suggesting that I dont expect any action on gun control because America is a gun-tooting country where [w]e live with the Second Amendment in the way its interpreted by the Supreme Court even though I think its irresponsible.

Without any citation, Watts claimed that [t]here have been 20 mass shootings in the state of Texas since 2009, two just this week and all weve seen Greg Abbott do is make it easier for dangerous people to get guns. In other words, typical classless behavior from a classless person. Search Shannon Watts and Dana Loesch and youll see why.
