Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders declined to directly address Fridays revelation that Russian actors sought to boost his presidential primary campaign and sink Hillary Clintons in 2016, instead insisting that the special counsels investigation proceed unimpeded.

It has been clear to everyone (except Donald Trump) that Russia was deeply involved in the 2016 elections and intends to be involved in the 2018 elections. It is the American people who should be deciding the political future of our country, not Mr. Putin and the Russian oligarchs, Sanders said in a statement. It is absolutely imperative that the Mueller investigation be allowed to go forward without obstruction from the Trump administration or Congress.

Sanders urging that special counsel Robert Mueller be protected echoes the concerns of Democrats across Capitol Hill.
