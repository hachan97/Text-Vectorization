New York Times political reporter Amy Chozick has written a book about covering both of Hillary Clintons presidential campaigns called Chasing Hillary.

Washington Post book reviewer Carlos Lozada showed that there was a reason the candidate was surrounded by female correspondents. They all felt her pain.

Chozick is indignant about the prejudice swirling around Clintons candidacy and fantasizes about defending her.

Bernies supporters, Republicans, and garden-variety Hillary haters always told me it wasnt about gender, she writes. Theyd vote for a woman, just not THAT woman. . . . I wanted to scream at every critic that thirty years of sexist attacks had turned her into that woman. That sooner or later, the higher we climb, the harder we work, we all become that woman.
