A Southern California city council voted Monday for the second time to cement its opposition to the states sanctuary law following a tense 5-hour debate and clashes between anti-sanctuary measure supporters and protesters.

Los Alamitos Council members voted 4-1 to opt out of a state law that prohibited state and local police agencies from informing federal authorities in cases when illegal immigrants facing deportation are released from detention.

It is the second time the council voted in favor of the ordinance as the citys laws required the council to have a second reading of the measure before officially approving it.

Councilman Mark Chirco was the only dissenting voice on the council. He said the council has no legal authority to approve the ordinance and criticized the council members for what he called being irresponsible, stating that the measure will open the city to lawsuits.
