Four men have been summonsed to appear in court after England rugby union coach Eddie Jones was verbally abused at a railway station in Manchester.

Jones, 58, received foul-mouthed taunts at Manchester Oxford Road station on 25 February, the day after Scotland beat England 25-13 in the Six Nations.

Four men will appear at Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court on 16 May.

Three of the men, aged 22, 23 and 25, are from Edinburgh, the other is a 25-year-old from South Queensferry.

The four were reported for an alleged public order offence, British Transport Police said.

Australian Jones had been asked to pose for photographs before the atmosphere turned sour, footage obtained by the BBC and released online showed.
