Madeleine Albright has both made and lived a lot of history. When she talks about a resurgence of fascism, she says it as someone who was born into the age of dictators. She was a small girl when her family fled Czechoslovakia after the Nazis consumed the country in 1939. After 10 days in hiding, her parents escaped Prague for Britain and found refuge in Notting Hill Gate, before it was fancy, in an apartment which backed on to Portobello Road. Her first memories of life in London are of disorientation. I didnt have a clue. My parents were very continental European and I didnt have siblings early on. I felt isolated. As Hitler unleashed the blitz, every night we went down to the cellar where everybody was sleeping.

She has since been back to the redbrick block in Notting Hill. I rang the doorbell of the person who lived in the apartment  it was a lot smaller than I remember it. I asked a stupid question: whether the cellar still existed. They said: Of course the cellar exists. So they took me down and I had this moment  the green paint was exactly the same. I remember the green paint.

It was decades later that she discovered that, though she was raised a Catholic, her parentage was Jewish and many of her family had been murdered in the Holocaust, including three grandparents.

From Notting Hill, the family moved out of central London to Walton-on-Thames, where they shared a house with some other Czechs. The bombs fell there too, but she enjoyed every minute of this part of her childhood. I went to school and we spent a lot of time in air raid shelters singing A Hundred Green Bottles Hanging on the Wall. It was less terrifying than it might have been because my parents had a capacity of making the abnormal seem normal.

She became a movie star. The Red Cross wanted to do a film about a refugee child. So I was the refugee child, and they gave me a pink rabbit as my pay.

The wartime British were very hospitable  up to a point. The British would say: Were so sorry your country has been taken over by a terrible dictator. Youre welcome here. What can we do to help you and when are you going home?

Her father, the diplomat Josef Korbel, was with the Czech government-in-exile. She recalls him refusing to take shelter from the bombers because he had to finish writing a broadcast for the BBC. After Hitlers defeat, Korbel took the family back to their homeland in the belief that Czechoslovakia would re-establish itself as a democracy but the country was soon gripped by another form of totalitarianism. After a Soviet-backed coup installed a communist satellite regime in 1948, the family fled again, this time seeking asylum in America and settling in Colorado. Maddy, as her classmates called her, was now 11. In America, people welcomed immigrants by saying: Were so sorry your country has been taken over by a terrible system. Youre welcome here. What can we do to help you and when will you become a citizen? She pauses for a beat, then adds: And that was different about America at that time.

Albrights early work as a journalist and a foreign policy scholar drew her into politics. In 1978, she sat on the National Security Council when Jimmy Carter was president and later represented the US as the countrys ambassador at the United Nations. In 1997, Bill Clinton made her secretary of state, the highest government office achievable under the US constitution by someone not a natural born US citizen. She was the first woman to lead US foreign policy.

Over four years as Americas chief diplomat, her life and views were again shaped by encounters with tyranny. She engaged with Kim Jong-il, father of North Koreas current jailer-in-chief, and found him, she recalls in her new book, cordial, courteous and pretty normal for someone whose fathers birthday is celebrated every year as the Day of the Sun. Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian autocrat, did not fit the stereotype of a fascist villain and liked to act the innocent even as his security forces attempted the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo. Hugo Chavez, the late ruler of Venezuela, was very charismatic and initially seemed to hold promise for his country when he supplanted a bunch of tired old men that were very elitist. When Recep Tayyip Erdogan first came to power in Turkey, he was a refreshing change from rule by people who live in big houses, or occasionally the military. These people initially did have some feel for the working class and then power went to their heads  all of them.

One chapter of her new book is about Vladimir Putin, whom she found to be so cold as to be almost reptilian but also a man of considerable, if dark, talents. Hes very smart. Hes played a weak hand really well. He has a larger agenda which is to separate us from our allies and it begins by separating central and eastern Europe from western Europe.

With the benefit of hindsight, she accepts that the west was slow to understand that Russians felt utterly humiliated after the cold war and ready to succumb to a nationalist strongman promising to make them great again. She recalls a Russian man complaining: We used to be a superpower and now were Bangladesh with missiles. Putin, she tells me, has seen himself as the redeemer of that man.

I wonder whether her first-hand encounters with despots had led her to identify any common personality traits. She laughs: Ill tell you  youll be surprised when you hear this  they seemed different when I met them. She cites the example of Viktor Orban, the self-styled illiberal democrat who rules Hungary. She first came to know him in the 1980s during Hungarys struggle for liberation from communist dictatorship. He was everybodys favourite dissident. He was funded by George Soros to go to Oxford. Hes the one who started Fidesz, the youth party. The age limit for the youth party changed as he got older, she adds with her hallmark waspishness. Orbans transformation in office has taken her by surprise. I didnt, I dont think any of us saw this coming.

Where we might be going is the chilling theme of Fascism: A Warning. The book is a cry of anguish about the global resurgence of authoritarianism and a lament over the decay of the liberal internationalist politics to which Albright has devoted her career. The work is also an act of homage to her father who wrote books about the perils of tyranny and worried that Americans were so accustomed to liberty  so very, very free, he wrote  that they might take democracy for granted. She quotes Primo Levi  Every age has its own fascism  and makes her case with observations about the autocrats she has dealt with and brisk histories of past dictators and the horrors that they unleashed. A devils portrait gallery includes Benito Mussolini, the original fascist, and Adolf Hitler, the most destructive. Then theres Donald Trump.

She agrees that we ought to be careful not to casually throw around the F-word lest we drain the potency from what should be a powerful term. Im not calling Trump a fascist, she says. Yet she seems to be doing all but that when she puts him in the same company as historical fascists in a book that seeks to sound an alarm bell about a fascist revival.

She frequently nudges the reader to make connections between the president of the United States and past dictatorships. She reminds us who first coined the Trumpian phrase drain the swamp. It was drenare la palude in the original, Mussolini Italian. She quotes Hitler talking about the secret of his success: I will tell you what has carried me to the position I have reached. Our political problems appeared complicated. The German people could make nothing of them... I...reduced them to the simplest terms. The masses realised this and followed me. Sound familiar?

I suggest to her that the book struggles to offer a satisfactory definition of fascism. Defining fascism is difficult, she responds. First of all, I dont think fascism is an ideology. I think it is a method, its a system.

It is in his methods that Trump can be compared with, if not precisely likened to, the dictators of the 1930s. Fascists are typically masters of political theatre. They feed on and inflame grievances by setting the people against their enemies. Fascists tell their supporters that there are simple fixes for complex problems. They present as national saviours and conflate themselves with the state. They seek to subvert, discredit and eliminate liberal institutions. She reminds us that they have often ascended to power through the ballot box and then undermined democracy from within. She is especially fond of a Mussolini quote about plucking a chicken feather by feather so that people will not notice the loss of their freedoms until it is too late.

In her book, Trump is one nasty plucker. She labels him the first anti-democratic president in modern US history. Those Trumpians who know their history might retort that previous American presidents have been accused of being enemies of democracy, including some who have become the most revered holders of the office. Abraham Lincoln was charged with tyranny by his opponents during the civil war. So was Franklin D Roosevelt when he was implementing the New Deal.

Trump is different, she insists. Look at his attacks on the institutions of liberal society as he Twitter-lashes the judiciary and the media. Outrageous, says Albright. It was Stalin who talked about the press being the enemy of the people.

I also think Trump does act as though hes above the law. He lies without shame, she says. He threatens to jail political competitors. He foments bigotry. He lavishes admiration on autocrats like Putin and by doing so encourages the worldwide drift to authoritarianism. Observe also, she adds, how Trump exploits a crowd.

He uses rallies in a strange way. We all, most of us that are public people, have somebody interrupting our speeches. Theres always somebody yelling something. And the question is: what do you do about it? Sometimes people are just escorted out or you dont pay any attention to it. What is fascinating in watching Trump is he loves the people yelling and he uses them so that it looks as though he is having conversations with the people on TV. Trump is, I think hes actually really smart  evil smart, is what I think.

The founding fathers endowed the US with a constitution that was forged to protect the country from leaders with tyrannical impulses. America has survived some dreadful presidents. When Trump is gone, does she not think it possible that we will eventually look back on him not as a crypto-dictator, but as an embarrassing spasm?

In the book I write that there are people who say this is alarmist. It is. Thats the purpose. Im concerned about complacency about it. This is a very deliberate warning.

The fear that Trump induces in American liberals is matched by the alarm he arouses among the United States traditional allies in the democracies. From Nato to the World Trade Organisation, he threatens to rip up institutions that have ordered the planet over many decades. Albright argues that the doctrine of America First, which conceives of the world as a battlefield in which every country is intent on dominating every other, encourages a Darwinian competition of tribal nationalisms. During her time as Washingtons chief diplomat, Albright was an unabashed exponent of America as the global beacon of liberty: the indispensable nation, as she once called her country. Should Europeans conclude that Trumpian America has become an unreliable ally? Regretfully, she agrees.

At the moment, it is hard to say to any European that the US is a reliable ally, which makes me furious because I do believe in the importance of American engagement. I always thought we were reliable.

True, the international architecture established in the late 1940s does require refurbishing. Institutions founded seven decades ago need fixing. Trump does have a point when he complains that Americans pay a lot more to sustain Nato than do the European countries, which rely on the defence pact for their security. The trouble with Trump, though, is he sees it all as transactional, as if it were a hotel where you keep raising the price and if you want to stay there, youre going to have to pay. That is not what its about.

Theres no sin about updating these things, but I dont understand, I truly dont, what the purpose is to destroy the system. What is the purpose of having destruction as an ideology?

The Trumpian rampage through the international order has been particularly challenging for Britain, which clings to a conceit that it has a special bond with the United States. Trying to navigate any sort of relationship, never mind a special one, has been a nightmare for Theresa May. This week Trump will land on these shores, where he will be greeted by hot protests on the streets and British officials in a cold sweat. Itll be interesting to see how he deals with the Queen since he really doesnt like women, remarks Albright. Hes unbelievable to Angela Merkel.

The Queen, who has a lifetime of experience dealing with strange and unsavoury characters, will probably handle Trump with her customary glacial implacability. May is the one facing the biggest challenge of Trump management. Can Albright, who teaches international statecraft at Georgetown University, offer the prime minister some guidance?

I have no idea, Albright confesses. I dont have advice. The device, theoretically, is to tell him how wonderful he is. And to agree with whatever he says  and thats distasteful. He is unpredictable except when people flatter him and allow him to dominate. I know what its like to be in diplomatic discussions with people that you dont respect. You do begin in some kind of civilised way, but ultimately you have to say what you think.

Memo to Mrs May: say what you think. It may not get you anywhere with Trump, but at least you will preserve your self-respect.

Albright is a friend to the country which took in her family when she was a young girl, but believes that true friends owe you their candour. Shes clear that Brexit  an exercise in economic masochism that Britons will long regret  is a terrible mistake.

I happen to think its a tragedy. Im not sure how or why it happened. I think some of it was miscalculation. From an American perspective  and this is somewhat selfish and self-centred  the UK has always been our bridge to the continent and very important in all kinds of aspects. Burning down that bridge is not sensible. I think its unfortunate, I really do. Much of politics and diplomacy is a story of unintended consequences of decisions and this is one of the big ones.

Had Albright had her way, the world would not be riding the wild rollercoaster that is Trump. He would have been sent back to reality TV and Hillary Clinton would be in the White House. She was a vigorous campaigner for her old friend and Albrights passion got the better of her when she coined the phrase: There is a special place in hell for women who dont help other women. That landed her in some trouble during the 2016 campaign. Like many of Hillarys chums, she is defensive about the campaigns failure and still struggling to make sense of it. Hillary did win the popular vote, she points out.

That she did, but it is scant consolation really.

Germany has had a female leader for more than a decade. Britain is on its second female prime minister. A woman has never been president of the United States. Does America have a problem with women in politics?

Must have, she replies. I dont understand it, frankly. We are very good at being No 1 in many things and yet we are not in this and I dont know the answer. Because there are certainly very qualified women.

When my name came up to be secretary of state, she recalls, you would think that I was an alien, you know. People actually said: The Arabs wont deal with a woman.

Her friend Hillary was, in CV terms, one of the most qualified people to run for the White House.

Ever. No question about it. Right.

More qualified than Trump or indeed Obama.

I think she would have been a remarkable president. And I think that its very disappointing. Its something that we all talk about. I dont know the answer.

At least part of the explanation for Clintons defeat was not to do with gender. It was failing to understand the forces powering her opponent. Clinton notoriously called his supporters the deplorables. Albright sounds similarly guilty of seeing the world through an elitists prism when she writes in her book: Globalisation... is not an ideological choice, but a fact of life.

Opponents retort that globalisation is an ideological choice. It was a very good choice for transnational corporations, for prosperous members of western societies, and for many developing countries which have seen their growth accelerated by free trade and the exchange of technology. Globalisation turned out to be  or has certainly come to be seen as being  a very bad choice for less affluent sections of western societies. Many folk felt dislocated and disadvantaged. Lecturing them that globalisation is just a fact of life  so suck it up  was surely one of the incitements for those people who voted for Trump, who chose Brexit and who support the rightwing populists surging across Europe.

It isnt just favouring the rich, she insists. Most of us are beneficiaries of globalisation, but a lot of people were not prepared for it in terms of their skill-set and we didnt consider that enough.

She also concedes that globalisation is faceless and everybody wants to have an identity.

But its one thing to be patriotic, its another if my identity hates your identity and then its nationalism and hyper-nationalism. Thats the very dangerous part.

Albright is a sage woman, but also one taken by mortified surprise by the turn the world has taken. In common with most liberal internationalists, she hadnt expected the arc of history to bend in this dark direction. When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, liberal capitalist democracy was thought to be irreversibly triumphant. Francis Fukuyama even wrote a book entitled The End of History.

History had other ideas. I suggest that it is not good enough for liberal internationalists to simply bewail Trump and his fellow travellers. They need to examine what they got wrong. Maybe there were too many complacent assumptions that the world had become permanently safe for democracy.

I dont know whether complacent [is the right word], she says. We were all initially enthusiastic, but then we became euphoric. One conclusion she draws is that democracy is obviously harder than we think.

Democracy is not the easiest form of government. It does require attention and participation and carrying out the social contract. And it doesnt deliver immediately. What we have to learn is how to get democracy to deliver because people want to vote and eat. But it just took me 10 minutes to explain it and thats the problem.

The things that are happening are genuinely, seriously bad. Some of them are really bad. Theyre not to do with Trump; it is the evolution of a number of different trends. All the various problems that we have, they cant be solved by simple slogans. But its easier to listen to some simple slogan.

Albright is far from alone in worrying about the future of liberal democracy. This anxiety is felt more acutely by a woman who was born in the time of Mussolini, Hitler and Stalin, who reached the peaks of international diplomacy when freedom seemed ascendant and has since observed the unravelling of so much hope. At the end of our conversation, I am left unsure whether she thinks democracy has the resilience to survive this testing time.

You ask if Im an optimist or a pessimist, she responds. I am an optimist who worries a lot.

That is probably as sensible a position as any in todays troubled and troubling world.
