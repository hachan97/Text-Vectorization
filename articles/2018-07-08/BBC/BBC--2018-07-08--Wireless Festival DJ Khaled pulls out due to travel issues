DJ Khaled has pulled out of his appearance at Wireless Festival due to "travel issues".

He should have been headlining the third day of the show at Finsbury Park in London but cancelled just hours before he was due on stage.

Fans had been asking questions after seeing a video of him in an Instagram post just hours before in an infinity pool on holiday in Mexico.

Drake was drafted in as the surprise headliner on Sunday evening.

BBC Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills tweeted: "I can hear @Drake from my house and it sounds incredible."

DJ Khaled, who collaborated with Rihanna on Wild Thoughts, had been due to close the festival but posted pictures of himself nowhere near London.

Just hours ago he shared a photo of him still on holiday.

And then he was on a private jet.

He's since posted a video from a pool and then a few hours after that the news came that he has cancelled his appearance at Wireless due to travel issues.

Newsbeat has contacted Roc Nation, the entertainment company that represents DJ Khaled, for comment but they haven't yet responded.
