After losing the Democratic primary to a white incumbent, former Colorado congressional candidate Saira Rao has decided it is time to give up on white people.

Rao tweeted a link to an April New York Times column asking the question Should I Give Up on White People?. Rao commented, Short and long answer: YES.

Rao, the daughter of Indian immigrants, challenged long-time Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette in the Denver congressional district, but only received 31 percent of the vote.

I stand by it, Rao told Colorado Politics about her tweeted statement. Its incumbent on white people and not people of color to solve it, Rao said, just as its incumbent on men to solve sexism.

If white people dislike being lumped in with white supremacists, that is because of their white fragility, Rao added.

Though she was running as a Democrat, Rao wrote in December column for The Huffington Post that she had broken up with the party after noticing that the love has been one-sided.
