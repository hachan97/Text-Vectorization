The State Department will publish new rules this week that would require most visitors and immigrants to the U.S. to turn over their recent social media histories, carrying out one of President Trumps key security enhancements from his extreme vetting executive order.

Travelers would also be asked to list previous phone numbers, email addresses and international travel during the previous five years, and to detail any immigration problems theyve had, whether with the U.S. or elsewhere. Theyll also be asked about potential family connections to terrorism.

And in a striking human rights move, would-be immigrants from countries where female genital mutilation is prevalent would be directed to a website ensuring theyre aware the practice  common in some African countries  is illegal in the U.S.
