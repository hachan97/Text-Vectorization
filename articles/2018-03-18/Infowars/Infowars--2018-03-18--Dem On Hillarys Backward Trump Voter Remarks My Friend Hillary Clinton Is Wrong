Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.) slammed Hillary Clinton for caustic remarks she made about President Donald Trump and his voters in India last week, saying Sunday she was wrong and her remarks were not helpful at all.

Clinton, who has laid blame on a variety of factors for her loss in the 2016 election, tore into the middle of the country while calling her voters representative of places that were optimistic and diverse.

All that red in the middle, where Trump won, what the map doesnt show you is that I won the places that represent two-thirds of Americas gross domestic product. So I won the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forward, she said.

[...] No, its not helpful at all, Durbin said. In fact, my friend Hillary Clinton is wrong. Thirty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump had voted for President Obama.
