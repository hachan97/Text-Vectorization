During her Saturday opening statement on Fox News Channels Justice, Jeanine Pirro blasted former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe for claiming victim status in his firing.

McCabe claimed his dismissal was an attempt to undermine special counsel Robert Muellers Russia investigation.

Pirro argued that McCabe should have been fired a long time ago and that he should have been taken out in handcuffs for lying under oath.

Andy, I dont know how to break this to you, but the only reason you are even in the news is because youre a liar, stated Pirro. And when you lie under oath and to the FBI, you are a wrongdoer, you are a cheat and offender. So, McCabe, are you a crook, too?
