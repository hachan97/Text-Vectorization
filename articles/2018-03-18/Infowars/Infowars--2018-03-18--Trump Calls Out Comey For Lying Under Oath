President Donald Trump tweeted Sunday that former FBI Director James Comey clearly lied under oath in his testimony before Congress in 2017.

Wow, watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G, he tweeted Sunday morning, When asked have you ever been an anonymous source ... or known someone else to be an anonymous source...? He said strongly never, no. He lied.

Indeed, it does appear that Comey may have misrepresented the truth during his congressional testimony in 2017. The following is an excerpt from his questioning before Congress:

Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation? GRASSLEY: Question two, relatively related, have you ever authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports about the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?
