Scientific American continues on its activist leftward path, diluting its scientific brand by transmitting biased anti-gun propaganda under the cover of academic sociology.

The latest entry was posted Wednesday and has become a popular post: Why Are White Men Stockpiling Guns?  Research suggests its largely because theyre anxious about their ability to protect their families, insecure about their place in the job market and beset by racial fears.

If that headline wasnt a giveaway, writer Jeremy Adam Smiths bio left little hope for an objective take: ....author or co-editor of four books, including The Compassionate Instinct and Are We Born Racist?

After pointing out that Since the 2008 election of President Obama, the number of firearms manufactured in the U.S. has tripled.... Smith asked So, who is buying all these guns  and why?

....The American citizen most likely to own a gun is a white male  but not just any white guy. According to a growing number of scientific studies, the kind of man who stockpiles weapons or applies for a concealed-carry license meets a very specific profile. These are men who are anxious about their ability to protect their families, insecure about their place in the job market, and beset by racial fears. They tend to be less educated....

But Stroud also discovered another motivation: racial anxiety. A lot of people talked about how important Obama was to get a concealed-carry license: Hes for free health care, hes for welfare. They were asking, Whatever happened to hard work? Obamas presidency, they feared, would empower minorities to threaten their property and families.
