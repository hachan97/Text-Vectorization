Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) on Sunday granted that the Trump administration may have had justification to fire former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, adding he couldnt know for sure.

Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he cannot be certain at this point whether McCabe was fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions for just cause. George Stephanopoulos, host of ABCs This Week, asked whether the Inspector Generals findings and the recommendation of FBI officials show that McCabe should have been terminated.

Does the fact that the Inspector General did find that [McCabe] lacked candor in some of his responses and that his firing was recommended by career FBI officials, does that give you pause and does it suggest that, in fact, his firing was or may be justified? Stephanopoulos asked.
