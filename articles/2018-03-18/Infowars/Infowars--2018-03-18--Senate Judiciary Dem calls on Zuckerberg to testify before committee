Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) on Saturday called on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before the Senate Judiciary committee following reports that a data firm took Facebook users private information for President Trumps 2016 presidential campaign.

Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. Its clear these platforms cant police themselves. Ive called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say trust us. Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary, Klobuchar, a member of the committee, wrote on Twitter.
