NBC News is just a gigantic dumpster fire these days, but then you already knew that.

In addition to all the sexual harassment allegations hovering around its icon Tom Brokaw, NBCs fake news division suffered yet another huge embarrassment by reporting a story that was so, so, so fake that even Special Counsel Robert Mueller apparently insisted they go back and correct it. That, friends, is seriously fake news.

Around noon, MSNBC  NBCs aggressively-fake news affiliate  reported that Muellers office has been wire-tapping the phone calls of former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, whom the Special Counsel Gestapo had already subjected to jack-booted thug raids on his home, office and hotel room in early April.
