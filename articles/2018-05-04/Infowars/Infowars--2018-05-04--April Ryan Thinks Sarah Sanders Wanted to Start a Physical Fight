White House reporter April Ryan told CNNs Don Lemon that Sarah Sanders wanted to start a physical fight with her.

At a recent White House Press Conference, Ryan told Sanders she seemed blindsided by a comment made by Rudy Guiliani, and Sanders replied, Well, with all due respect, you actually dont know much about me in terms of what I feel and what I dont.

Ryan twisted Sanders comment during an interview with Don Lemon, saying, For Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the presidential spokesperson, the mouthpiece for the President of the United States, to say, You dont know me, in certain quarters in this nation, that starts a physical fight. I was very shocked. It was street. I will even go beyond that, it was gutter.

Ryan and Sanders have gotten into it before and this tiff will probably not be the last.
