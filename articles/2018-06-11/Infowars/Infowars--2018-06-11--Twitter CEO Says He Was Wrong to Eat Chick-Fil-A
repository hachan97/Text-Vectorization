Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Sunday expressed regret over eating at Chick-fil-A, because of the chicken companys CEOs personal views on gay marriage.

Dorsey tweeted a screenshot from his phone that showed a purchase he had made at Chick-fil-A using a mobile application. After a liberal backlash, however, Dorsey apologized for eating at the popular fast food restaurant.

At issue was Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathys 2012 support for defining marriage as between a man and a woman, which he described as the biblical definition of a family.
