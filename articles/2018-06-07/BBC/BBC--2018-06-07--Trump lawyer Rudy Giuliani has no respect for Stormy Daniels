A lawyer for US President Donald Trump has said a porn actress who claims to have had sex with Mr Trump does not deserve "respect" due to her sex work.

"I respect women - beautiful women and women with value - but a woman who sells her body for sexual exploitation I don't respect," said Rudy Giuliani.

"Someone who sells his or her body for money has no good name," he added.

A lawyer for actress Stormy Daniels, who is suing Mr Trump for defamation, called Mr Giuliani "an absolute pig".

Speaking at an investment conference in Tel Aviv, Israel, Mr Giuliani told a panellist: "I'm sorry I don't respect a porn star the way I respect a career woman or a woman of substance or a woman who... isn't going to sell her body for sexual exploitation."

"I mean, she has no reputation. If you're going to sell your body for money, you just don't have a reputation. I may be old fashioned." he continued.

In response, Ms Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, called the former New York mayor a "misogynist".

He added: "His client Mr Trump didn't seem to have any 'moral' issues with her and others back in 2006."

Ms Daniels claims that she and Mr Trump had sex once during a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe.
