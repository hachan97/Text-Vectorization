Watch "CNN Tonight" at 10 p.m. ET Thursday for Van Jones' exclusive interview with Kim Kardashian West on her reaction to President Donald Trump's commutation of Alice Marie Johnson.

"Thank you, President Trump for really seeing me, not just looking at some data about my crime, but actually looking at the person who I have become now and having faith that I deserved a second chance in life," Johnson said on CNN's "New Day" Thursday morning. "President Trump made me having a wonderful life possible, and I'm just so thankful to him."

Johnson was a first-time nonviolent drug offender, who had already served 21 years of a life sentence after she was convicted on charges of conspiracy to possess cocaine and attempted possession of cocaine, according to the nonprofit Can-Do, which advocates for clemency for non-violent drug offenders before being released Wednesday.

Trump commuted Johnson's sentence a week after Kim Kardashian West pleaded her case during an Oval Office meeting with Trump.

Trump wished Johnson good luck in a Thursday morning tweet, in which he told her to "have a wonderful life." When a CNN reporter showed Johnson the tweet earlier Thursday, she grinned ear to ear. "I'm so just amazed to hear that I'm actually one of his tweets," she told "New Day." "I love it!"
