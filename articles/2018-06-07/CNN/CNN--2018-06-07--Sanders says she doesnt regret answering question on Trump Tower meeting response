When asked by CNN's Chris Cuomo on Wednesday night if she regretted answering the question, Sanders said: "No, I don't."

Sanders continuously directed questions about the letter by Trump's attorneys to the President's outside counsel.

"We are purposefully walling ourselves off and allowing the outside counsel to do their job and we're doing ours," Sanders said on "Cuomo Prime Time."

During Monday's press briefing, CNN previously reported, Sanders was asked by three reporters about the conflicting statements. Following the White House press briefing on Monday, CNN reported that Trump's attorney Jay Sekulow said he stood by the assertion in the legal team's letter to the special counsel claiming the President had "dictated" the Trump Jr. statement. "I wish that we spent a lot less time focused on things that the American people don't care about, I wish we spent a lot less time talking about this witch hunt, and that we talked about things that impacted everyday Americans," Sanders said Wednesday.
