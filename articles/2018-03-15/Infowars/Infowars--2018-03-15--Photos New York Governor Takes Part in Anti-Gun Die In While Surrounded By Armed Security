New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday joined the list of hypocritical politicians and celebrities who call for further gun control, whilst being surrounded by armed guards.

In an orchestrated photo op, Cuomo took to the streets of Lower Manhattan and joined protests against gun owners and the NRA.

Cuomo even lay down on the ground with protesters as they conducted a die-in and chanted enough is enough in response to the recent school shooting in Florida.

Twitter users noted, however, that the governor was surrounded by armed security guards watching his every move:
