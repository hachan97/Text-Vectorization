Illegal immigrants plan on rallying in Hartford on Thursday morning to push for a proposal that would help give children access to higher education.

Illegal immigrant students, faith leaders, and allies will gather at the Capital for #AffordToDream Week Of Action in support of equal access to higher education for immigrant youth.

The aim is to build support for the bi-partisan proposal that would help illegal immigrant students access financial aid.
