CNN host Anderson Cooper remarked Thursday night that President Trumps interview on Fox & Friends earlier in the day sounded like the rantings of Richard Nixon.

Coopers comments on his show came after law professor Alan Dershowitz weighed in on Trumps interview by focusing on Trumps suggestion that he could interfere with the Justice Departments investigations.

I think it would go down a very bad road for us to start parsing the presidents words to determine whether or not the president of the United States is exercising his authority under Article II or violating the law, Dershowitz said.

How do you ever interpret statements made by Donald Trump? he said. He made a vague, general statement intended to convey different points to different people.
