Ive been thinking a lot about how to find calm in a time that is so volatile. The political chaos coming from the White House  sex (and sexism) scandals, firings, tweets and the never-ending Russia saga make it difficult to feel like youre on steady footing.

So instead of trying to keep track of it all, Im homing in on the things that give me hope. Recently, thats the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas and their young peers across the country. Its been a week since the march, and Im still overwhelmed with gratitude for these young people and their ability to organize, articulate their grief and inspire us all. I wish they didnt have to do it  but wow, are they capable.

Thats my advice for the week: if youre feeling the overwhelm, find that one thing that may give you a glimmer of hope or feeling of wellbeing. We could all use it.
