Morning anchor Alisyn Camerota was floored on Friday that colleges are rejecting Parkland, Florida student-turned-anti-gun activist David Hogg.

David, I am stunned that four colleges rejected you, Camerota told the student, gushing that hes taken the country by storm.

What kind of dumbass colleges dont want you! she asked Hogg, who laughed.

She wanted to know if the schools turned him down before or after the shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School.

They rejected me about two weeks ago, most of them, Hogg said.

He tweeted about his rejections at the time:

He told Camerota its competitive and hard to get into schools.

You can still change the world whether youre in college or not, he said.

On Wednesday, the New York Post reported the senior is having trouble being accepted.

Some state colleges in California are apparently not impressed by the Parkland high school shooting survivor who helped become a voice for a global gun control movement.

David Hogg, 17, has so far been rejected by four University of California campuses  UCLA, UCSD, UCSB and UC Irvine, he told TMZ.

According to the UC site, a minimum 3.4 GPA is required for non-California residents to get in. The Florida teen has a 4.2 GPA and an SAT score of 1270.

Hes been accepted to Cal State San Marcos and Cal Poly, and in his home state, Florida Atlantic University  but hes not yet sure what hell do after graduating, he said.

At this point, were already changing the world, Hogg, told TMZ. If colleges want to support us in that, great, if they dont, it doesnt matter, were still going to change the world.
