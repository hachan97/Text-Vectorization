During a discussion at the University of Pennsylvania on Thursday, former Vice President Joe Biden stated that the 2nd Amendment has been interpreted badly and the nation has decided it cant ignore the prostitution of the amendment.

Biden said, I think theres a 2nd Amendment. I think the 2nd Amendment is being very badly interpreted. Its not consistent with what theyre  our founders intended, in my view. You saw Justice John Paul Stevens say that we should  because its been so prostituted, we should repeal the 2nd Amendment. It was about a standing militia. Its a long story. I wont go into all the legal side of that having taught it in law school. But theres rational or irrational policy.

He added, Whats happened here is, the nation as a whole has decided it can no longer, in my view, continue to turn a blind eye to the prostitution of the 2nd Amendment here, and no longer can turn a blind eye to the enormous damage being done, not just in our schools, but on our streets, right here in Philly and Wilmington, Delaware, where Im from, every night.
