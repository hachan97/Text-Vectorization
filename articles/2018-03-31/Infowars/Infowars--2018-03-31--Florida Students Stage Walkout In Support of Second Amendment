Two weeks after students in Central Florida and around the world walked out of class in solidarity with Parkland survivors, another walkout, this time in favor of gun rights, occurred at Rockledge High School.

Im pro-Second Amendment. I wouldnt mind deeper background checks, of course, but the Second Amendment will not be infringed upon, said student Anna Delaney.
