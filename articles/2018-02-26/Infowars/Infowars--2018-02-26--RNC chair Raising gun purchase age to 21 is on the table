Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel believes that raising the age to purchase a gun from 18 to 21 is on the table as Republicans toss out potential legislative ideas in response to last weeks school shooting in Parkland, Fla.

McDaniel said that while the top priority is to increase security in schools and the safety of students, raising the minimum age is something Republicans could support.

Were going to see where the conversation goes, McDaniel told the Washington Examiner. I think the presidents been very thoughtful in what hes proposing. Hes listening to these parents. I think universally, we want to make sure our schools are safe. Period.

I dont know. Well see where that goes. I think its on the table, McDaniel said of raising the minimum age. We have to look at the whole picture.
