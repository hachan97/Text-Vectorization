Eric Trump on Monday offered support for raising the federal age limit for purchasing assault weapons to 21.

Im a big Second Amendment person. I dont think its a big deal if you raise the age to 21, he said during an interview on Fox & Friends.

The presidents son also said that he thinks everybody would welcome more comprehensive background checks.

At least personally, I dont want to see a whack job get any kind of dangerous object of any kind, he said.
