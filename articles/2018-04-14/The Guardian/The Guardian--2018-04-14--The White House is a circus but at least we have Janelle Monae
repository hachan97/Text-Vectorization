Well, no one could say this week has been boring.

I could list all of the news items that have come out (and continue to come out as I write this) over the last few days. I could talk about how all of it is overwhelming and numbing. Instead, though, Im just going to bask in the absurdity of it all.

We have a ridiculous clown as president. His party has abandoned any integrity they may have had to defend him. We look like a joke to the rest of the world. This is our country now.

Id like to say that I think things will get better, but who knows!? So for now, Im going to roll with it. One ticket to the circus, please.

Janelle Monae released the vagina anthem weve all been waiting for.

Melissa Harris-Perry on an issue #MeToo forgot, Jaya Saxena on the class implications of bad skin, and this incredible (and disturbing) piece from Linda Villarosa on the maternal mortality rate of black women.

On the very sad end of Our Bodies, Ourselves and what that means for the future of feminist organizing.

Trumps lawyer negotiated a more than $1m settlement to hide the fact that Republican fundraiser got a Playboy model pregnant. She later had an abortion, once again showing that the GOP is against abortion only when its convenient. On a scale of one to 10, Im at a solid nine.

My sister spotted this sign in a Queens pizzeria and its going to help me get through the next month, at least.
