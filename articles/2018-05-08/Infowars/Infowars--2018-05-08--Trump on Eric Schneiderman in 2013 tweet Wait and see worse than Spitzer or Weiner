Did President Trump know something?

Almost five years ago, Mr. Trump tweeted that Eric Schneiderman, then the new New York attorney general, was worse than two well-known Democratic sex criminals.

On Monday night, Mr. Schneiderman was the object of the latest #MeToo bombshell. The New Yorker reported in a lengthy feature about four women  two named, two unnamed  accusing Mr. Schneiderman of slapping and choking them in intimate situations without consent and with threatening them with surveillance and death if they talked.

Within hours of the articles publication, Mr. Schneiderman resigned.

Mr. Trump compared Mr. Schneiderman in a 2013 tweet to Anthony Weiner and Eliot Spitzer, both New York Democrats with national political ambitions brought down by sex charges  respectively, sexting with a minor and purchase of prostitutes.

Weiner is gone, Spitzer is gone  next will be lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman. Is he a crook? Wait and see, worse than Spitzer or Weiner, Mr. Trump tweeted.
