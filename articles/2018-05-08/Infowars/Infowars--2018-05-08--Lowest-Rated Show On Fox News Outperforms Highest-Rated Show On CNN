The least-watched prime-time program on Fox News drew more viewers than its most-watched counterpart on CNN.

Fox News at Night with Shannon Bream drew an average of 1.5 million viewers in the month of April, according to Nielsen ratings reported by the Conservative Tribune. CNNs most-watched show, Anderson Cooper 360, had an average audience of 1.1 million and placed a distant 24th among cable programs.

Several shows in Foxs morning and daytime lineups also outperformed AC360, including Americas Newsroom, Fox & Friends, Outnumbered, Your World with Neil Cavuto, Happening Now, Shepard Smith Reporting, Outnumbered Overtime and Daily Briefing with Dana Perino.

Its the latest bad news for CNN, which saw prime-time viewership decline 17 percent in the first quarter of 2018.
