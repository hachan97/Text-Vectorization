Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) on Friday colorfully explained he doesnt care what critics say about his relationship with President Donald Trump, arguing that working with the president doesnt make him two-faced.

If you dont like me working with President Trump to make the world a better place, I dont give a shit, Graham told CNNs Kate Bolduan.

Bolduan was questioning Graham about Trumps criticism of his predecessor Barack Obama when she expressed doubt that one can trust anything the president says. Trump blamed Obama for Russia annexing Crimea, and while Graham defended the president, Bolduan found Trumps blame to be inconsistent with his administrations sanctions on Russia for its actions in Ukraine.

Graham said he is focused on Trumps results rather than his style, prompting Bolduan to target the senators own relationship with Trump.

You went from  Im going to sum it up  hating him, making fun of him, finding peace with trying to work with him, where you can work with him, then he comes out and hits you again on whatever he decided to on a given day, Bolduan said. Do you trust him now?
