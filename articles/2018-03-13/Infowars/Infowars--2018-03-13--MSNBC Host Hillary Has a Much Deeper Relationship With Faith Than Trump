An angry Katy Tur on Monday hailed Hillary Clinton as far more religious than Donald Trump.

During a discussion on evangelical voters with CBNs David Brody, the MSNBC host reacted to the idea that some Christians prized Trumps pro-life stance over other issues: But when youre talking about people of faith, Hillary Clinton has a much deeper relationship with faith than Donald Trump does.

As the segment went on, the MTP Daily guest host became increasingly unhinged, saying of Trump: He is tearing apart and just trashing the foundation of our democracy, our First Amendment. Yeah, you are all for the Second Amendment but hes trashing the First Amendment.
