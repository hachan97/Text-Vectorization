Shortly after President Donald Trump ousted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and tapped CIA Director Mike Pompeo to take his place, State Department spokesperson Steve Goldstein issued a statement on the firing thats frankly astonishing. It undercut the White House so aggressively that Goldstein was fired shortly after it went out.

Goldstein confirmed that Tillerson was fired, a rarity in a Washington where resigns to spend more time with his family is the norm. But the statement goes further than that, revealing that Trump did not inform Tillerson of the reason for his firing or even speak to the secretary personally before dismissing him.

Ive been in Washington covering foreign policy and politics for nearly a decade now. Ive never seen anything like this statement. Heres the full text, as emailed to reporters:

The Secretary had every intention of staying because of the critical progress made in national security. He will miss his colleagues at the the [sic] Department of State and the foreign ministers he has worked with throughout the world. The Secretary did not speak to the President and is unaware of the reason, but he is grateful for the opportunity to serve, and still believes strongly that public service is a noble calling. We wish Secretary Designate Pompeo well.

In the Trump administration, chaos is something of a norm. But this is shocking even when grading on that curve.
