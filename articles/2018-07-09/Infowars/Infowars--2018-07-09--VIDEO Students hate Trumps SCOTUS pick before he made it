This month, Justice Anthony Kennedy announced he would be retiring from the Supreme Court of the United States, giving President Trump an opportunity to nominate a potential replacement.

Instantly, Trumps political opponents began questioning the credentials of those who were thought to be on his shortlist for the position.

The same sentiment was seen on social media from pundits and members of Congress alike  but what would college students have to say about the matter? Did they have substantive reasons for not trusting the potential replacement, or were they simply set on opposing any Trump nominee?

To find out, I headed to New York University to ask students what they thought about who Trump had chosen to replace Justice Kennedy.

Despite the fact that Trumps decision was still days away from being finalized, students unanimously condemned Trumps move, harshly criticizing the presidents nonexistent nominee.

Hes quite extreme in his views, said one student of the fictitious Judge.

I saw it all over the news, that hes like racist, another student added, referring to the announcement that hadnt yet happened.

I saw the new nominee is like racist, and hes starting a new wave of something very negative, and Im really scared about the future and what choices he will make, another pupil added.

When asked if shed seen the online coverage of the event, one faculty member described witnessing outrage... as it should be.

What else did students have to say? Did anyone realize the decision had not yet been made?
