A mission is underway to rescue 12 Thai boys and their soccer coach who have been trapped in a cave in northern Thailand for two weeks. A team of expert divers deployed Sunday morning to help guide the boys through the 2.5 partially submerged miles to safety  an operation that could last up to four days. Thus far, eight of the 13 have made it out as the result of two rescue missions.

On Saturday, June 23, a group of 12 boys between the ages of 11 and 16 went with their soccer coach to explore a cave in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave system. As they entered, heavy rain picked up, and the rising water trapped them inside. The group of 13 was missing for nine days before they were discovered by divers last Monday.

People in Thailand and around the world rejoiced when the group was found, but there was another problem: getting them out. Oxygen levels in the cave are dropping, making it risky to wait until monsoon season ends in October and water levels fall.

And so, a rescue mission to get the team, whose nickname is the Wild Boars, out of the cave began on Sunday morning, when 13 specialist divers and five Thai Navy SEALS were sent in to try to reach the boys and escort them out.
