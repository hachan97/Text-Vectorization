Germany midfielder Emre Can will leave Liverpool when his contract expires this summer.

Can, 24, moved to Anfield from Bayer Leverkusen in July 2014 for 10m.

The Germany player has been linked with a move to Italian champions Juventus.

Right-back Jon Flanagan, 25, who spent the end of the 2017-18 season on loan at Championship club Bolton, is also leaving Anfield after failing to make a first-team appearance in Jurgen Klopp's team last season.

Can was signed by Brendan Rodgers and made his 167th and final appearance for Liverpool in last month's Champions League final defeat by Real Madrid.

Academy graduate Flanagan departs having featured in 51 senior games following his 2011 debut against Manchester City.

Flanagan has one England cap after playing in a friendly against Ecuador in 2014.
