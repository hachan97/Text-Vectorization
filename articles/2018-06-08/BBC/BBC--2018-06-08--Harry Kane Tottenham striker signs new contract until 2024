England captain Harry Kane has signed a new six-year contract with Tottenham Hotspur until 2024.

Striker Kane, 24, scored 30 Premier League goals as Spurs finished third in the table last season and is about to lead England at the World Cup.

Kane's previous contract, which was announced in December 2016 and was reportedly worth more than 100,000 a week, had been due to expire in 2022.

"I'm looking forward to the future," Kane told Tottenham's website.

"It's been fantastic to consistently get in the Champions League so I'm really excited to have another go at that, and with the Premier League and FA Cup, we'll look to go as far as we can.

"I'm really excited about the World Cup, so it's nice to get this done before that and I'm just looking to go out there and enjoy it now."

In May, Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino signed a new five-year deal, keeping him at the north London club until 2023.

Kane finished 2017 as the year's top goalscorer in European football with 56 goals for club and country, and is Tottenham's leading scorer in the Premier League era.

He broke former England captain Alan Shearer's record for the most Premier League goals in a calendar year in 2017, netting 39.
