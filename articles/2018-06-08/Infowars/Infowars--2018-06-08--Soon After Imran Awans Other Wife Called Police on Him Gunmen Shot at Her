Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz indicted former IT aide, Imran Awan, was married to two Virginia women simultaneously, and 15 days after one of them told police that Imran kept her like a slave, gunmen shot into her family home, according to police reports filed in Pakistan.

The shooting at Sumaira Siddique allegedly occurred in Pakistan in August 2016  days after the House Inspector General informed the Committee on House Administration that Imran allegedly committed cybersecurity violations. In a report filed with the local police, Siddiques father, who owns the home, said he believed Siddique had been targeted.

The shooting was unsolved, though in a separate case, Imrans stepmother, Samina Gilani, alleged in court papers filed in April 2017 that Imran said he would do harm to me and my family members back in Pakistan and one of my cousins here in Baltimore. He also threatened that he has the power to kidnap my family members back in Pakistan.
