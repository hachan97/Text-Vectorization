Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) took a jab at President Trump on Saturday after threatening to impose new tariffs on Canada and pulling his endorsement of a joint communique signed with other Group of Seven (G-7) members at this weekends summit.

To our allies: bipartisan majorities of Americans remain pro-free trade, pro-globalization & supportive of alliances based on 70 years of shared values, McCain tweeted late Saturday.

Americans stand with you, even if our president doesnt, the senator added.

McCain was responding to a series of tweets Trump sent Saturday after leaving the G-7 summit early to depart for a planned sit-down with North Korea in Singapore.
