White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called out a CNN producer for fake news about the G7 Summit on Saturday.

The saga started when Dan Scavino, an assistant to the president, tweeted out a behind-the-scenes photo of negotiations at the annual summit.

CNN producer Greg Hughes, apparently unhappy that the photo showed a number of world leaders gathering around President Trump, insisted that the photo was just clever visual messaging and claimed without evidence that the event was a group signing.
