A federal grand jury in Virginia approved a new set of charges from special counsel Robert Mueller against former Trump campaign aides Paul Manafort and Rick Gates Thursday afternoon.

Mueller had indicted Manafort and Gates on a combined 12 counts last October in Washington, DC, but he has now assembled a superseding indictment with a combined 32 counts of tax, financial, and bank fraud charges against the two men  in Virginia rather than Washington.

There have been reports that Gates was close to making a plea deal with Muellers team, but that seems not to have panned out. Read the new indictment here:
