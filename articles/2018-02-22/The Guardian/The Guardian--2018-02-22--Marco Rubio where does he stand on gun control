Just two years ago, the National Rifle Association (NRA) spent more than $1m during a single election cycle to support the re-election of the Florida senator Marco Rubio.

Today, Rubio is trying to position himself as a Republican seeking compromise on gun control laws. He agreed to join CNNs town hall to discuss  with angry, grieving student survivors  what needs to be done after a school shooting left 17 people dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Florida.

Only GOP at CNN townhall, Rubio tweeted on Wednesday, in response to criticism from a Florida newspaper that he had long dodged the issue of gun control.

Heres what Rubio has said about gun control and what hes saying now:

Given the amount of money Rubio has received from the NRA, his support is surprising  but welcome, said the New York state senator Brian Kavanagh, who has been leading an effort to pass these protection orders at the state level across the country.

Whether or not Rubio can get fellow congressional Republicans on board, he could still, Kavanagh pointed out, take action in Florida.

I hope he will follow up his words with real action to ensure [this legislation] is enacted in his home state, Kavanagh said.
