Say what you like about Wayne LaPierre, the head of the National Rifle Association. He knows his audience.

A week after the tragic mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, LaPierre took the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington to defend Americas right to bear arms.

The speech was also an opportunity for the audience to play NRA hate bingo, as LaPierre ticked off an exhaustive  and exhausting  list of the associations bogeymen and women: Barack Obama, the media, Hollywood, European-style socialists, George Soros, Mexicans, China, Black Lives Matter and NFL players who refuse to stand for the national anthem.

Having thoroughly triggered his audience, he went on to mention God, family, the flag, capitalism and all those other things his enemies  supposedly  despise.
