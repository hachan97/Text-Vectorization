The idea of keeping people younger than 21 from buying rifles including AR-15 style firearms has been proposed, including in a bill that will be introduced in the Senate. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that age at purchase is something they will look at.

NRA Public Affairs Director Jennifer Baker said in a statement, "Federal Law prohibits adults under the age of 21 from purchasing a handgun from a licensed firearm dealer. Legislative proposals that prevent law-abiding adults aged 18-20 years old from acquiring rifles and shotguns effectively prohibits them for purchasing any firearm, thus depriving them of their constitutional right to self-protection."

She added, "We need serious proposals to prevent violent criminals and the dangerously mentally ill from acquiring firearms. Passing a law that makes it illegal for a 20 year-old to purchase a shotgun for hunting or an adult single mother from purchasing the most effective self-defense rifle on the market punishes law-abiding citizens for the evil acts of criminals. "

Florida student to NRA and Trump: 'We call BS' Florida student to NRA and Trump: 'We call BS' Baker said that "the NRA supports efforts to prevent those who are a danger to themselves or others from getting access to firearms. At the same time, we will continue to oppose gun control measures that only serve to punish law-abiding citizens. These are not mutually exclusive or unachievable goals."
