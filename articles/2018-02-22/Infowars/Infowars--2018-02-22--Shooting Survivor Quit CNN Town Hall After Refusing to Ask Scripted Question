Colton Haab, a student who survived last weeks mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, refused to participate in a CNN Town Hall on Wednesday night after he was told to ask a scripted question.

Haab, a junior at the high school, told Fort Lauderdale ABC affiliate WPLG that CNN invited him to speak at the televised town hall in nearby Sunrise, Florida, and that he and his parents had dressed up for the occasion.

But CNN then told Haab he would have to read a question that CNN had prepared for him:

Haab: I expected to be able to ask my questions and give my opinion on my questions. Reporter Janine Stanwood: But Colton Haab, a member of the Junior ROTC, who shielded classmates in the midst of terror, says he did not get to share his experience. Haab: CNN had originally asked me to write a speech and questions, and it ended up being all scripted. Stanwood: Colton wrote questions about school safety, suggested using veterans as armed school security guards, but claims CNN wanted him to ask a scripted question instead. So he decided not to go. Haab: I dont think that its going to get anything accomplished. Its not going to ask the true questions that all the parents and teachers and students have.
