President Trump took issue Thursday with media reports declaring that he is advocating arming all teachers in schools, clarifying that he supports a move to arm only teachers who have specialized training.

Referring to gun free schools as a magnet for bad people, Trump hit out at CNN and NBC, charging that those networks were misrepresenting his comments.

Trump made the comments during a sit down listening session Wednesday with survivors of last weeks Florida school shooting.

After a parent raised the idea of arming teachers and administrators with concealed guns, Trump said it was certainly a point we will discuss.

If you had a teacher who was adept at firearms, that could very well end the attack very quickly, Trump said.

Were going to be looking at that very strongly. And I think a lot of people are going to be opposed to it. I think a lot of people are going to like it.

Continuing to address the media via Twitter, the President added that highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would be an effective deterrent to prevent future deadly incidents.

Trump declared that cowards would avoid targeting schools if they knew that there was no chance of them being able to attack defenseless people.
