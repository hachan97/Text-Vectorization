The Chicago Police Department said it is investigating a threatening message made to the Trump Tower in Chicago on Wednesday.

Authorities responded to the building in the 400 block of North Wabash Avenue after a threat was made from a location near the Trump Tower around 5 p.m. EST on Wednesday, via electronic means, the police confirmed.

A complimentary iPad was given to a hotel guest. That guest wrote down a threatening message to the hotel which was discovered when the iPad was returned upon checkout, a Chicago Police Department officer told the Hollywood Reporter.

No other details regarding the incident were given out. However, the area was later said to be safe and clear by officers. No one was taken into custody and a motive behind the incident has not yet been determined.
