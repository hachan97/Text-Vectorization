A new Rasmussen poll taken in the aftermath of the Parkland school shooting finds that the majority of Americans do not trust the government to fairly enact new gun control laws.

The survey, which was conducted at the start of the week, finds, Only 24% of Americans trust the government to fairly enforce gun control laws.

A full 58 per cent of Americans lack trust in the governments ability to implement such laws, while 18% are not sure.

The numbers emphasize how while support for new gun control measures is clearly a majority opinion, confidence in the success of those measures having any positive effect isnt solid.

Almost half (49%) of Americans think more gun control laws will have no impact on violent crime. Even amongst Democrats, a relatively slim majority, 56 per cent, think new gun restrictions will decrease violent crime.

A Quinnipiac poll released earlier this week found that support for gun control is at an all time high, with 67% of Americans supporting what the media has termed an assault weapons ban.

President Donald Trump has called for allowing gun adept teachers with military or special training experience to carry a concealed weapon in schools so they could immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions.

Meanwhile, NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre told an audience at CPAC today, The elites dont care not one whit about Americas school system and school children. Their goal is to eliminate the Second Amendment (of the Constitution) and our firearms freedoms so they can eradicate all individual freedoms.
