Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., said Wednesday that Democrats were more likely to be mass murderers in comparison to Republicans in an interview discussing the high school shooting in Parkland, Fla.

Its interesting that so many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats, Tenney told host Fred Dicker on Albanys Talk 1300 Radio. But the media doesnt talk about that either.

Tenney, who faces a tight race to secure a second term representing New Yorks 22nd congressional district, made the comments in response to Dicker saying inner-city gun violence claimed more victims than mass shootings.

While we know the perpetrators of these atrocities have a wide variety of political views, my comments are in response to a question about the failure to prosecute illegal gun crime. I will continue to stand up for law-abiding citizens who are smeared by anti-gun liberal elitists, she later clarified to CNN.
