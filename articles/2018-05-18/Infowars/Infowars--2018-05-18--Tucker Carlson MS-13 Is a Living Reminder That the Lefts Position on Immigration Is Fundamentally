Thursday on Fox News Channels Tucker Carlson Tonight, host Tucker Carlson challenged Democrats that objected to President Donald Trumps remarks earlier this week about the gang MS-13.

Carlson said the inspiration for that backlash aimed at Trump for those comments was that it challenged the lefts view on immigration  an idea that all immigrants are good.

Why would the left be defending the countrys most violent street gang? Carlson said. Trump has made them irrational. That is part of it. But the left also senses a threat to its basic worldview. MS-13 is a living reminder that the lefts position on immigration is fundamentally a lie. The media tell you every day that every immigrant, legal or not, is a future brain surgeon or tech company founder. Therefore, immigration controls are unnecessary.

If they admit MS-13 is bad and must be stopped, theyd have to also admit that when some countries send their people here, they arent sending their best, he continued. A lot of immigrants are great, for sure. Some are rapists, though. Some joint MS-13. Thats just true. They arent all the same because people arent all the same. Thats the point of our immigration law. Theyre not the same. We should sort the good from the bad.
