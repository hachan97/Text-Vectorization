Friday morning, an as-yet-unidentified gunman opened fire on students and staff in Santa Fe High School in Santa Fe, Texas. At least eight people are known to have been killed, according to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez.

Shortly after news of the Santa Fe shooting broke, President Trump gave a public statement on the tragedy. Here is a full transcript of his statement; a video of the comments, courtesy of C-SPAN, is appended below:

Unfortunately, I have to begin by expressing our sadness and heartbreak over the deadly shooting at Santa Fe High School in Texas that took place moments ago. Were closely monitoring the situation and federal authorities are coordinating with local officials. This has been going on too long in our country. Too many years, too many decades now. We grieve for the terrible loss of life and send our support and love to everyone affected by this absolutely horrific attack to the students, families, teachers and personnel at Santa Fe High. Were with you in this tragic hour, and we will be with you forever. My administration is determined to do everything in our power to protect our students, secure our schools, and keep weapons out of the hands of those who pose a threat to themselves and to others. Everyone must work together at every level of government to keep our children safe. May God heal the injured and may God comfort the wounded, and may God be with the victims and with the victims families. A very sad day, very, very sad.
