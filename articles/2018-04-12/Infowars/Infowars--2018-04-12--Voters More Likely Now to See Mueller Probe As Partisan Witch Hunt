Following Special Counsel Robert Muellers invasion of the office and home of President Trumps personal lawyer, voters increasingly believe Muellers probe is politically biased. But they also tend to think he is unlikely to nail the president for anything criminal.

The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that 46% of Likely U.S. Voters still believe Muellers investigation is an honest attempt to determine criminal wrongdoing, but thats down from 52% last October. Forty percent (40%) now consider Muellers probe a partisan witch hunt, an eight-point increase from 32% in the earlier survey. Fourteen percent (14%) are undecided.
