Wednesday on ABCs The View, co-host Meghan McCain said if President Donald Trump fired special counsel Robert Mueller, there would be riots in Washington D.C. at levels we havent seen.

McCain said, We are sitting around pontificating about something that hasnt happened, thats going on a lot of unnamed sources so I dont think we should get too far ahead of our skis. I do think everything youre saying about what would happen if he does fires Mueller, I have said, Lindsey Graham has said its political suicide. I one hundred percent think there would be  I think there would actually be rioting in Washington, D.C. I think it would be at levels we havent seen.

Co-host Whoopi Goldberg interjected, Now that would be fun to watch I have to say.

McCain added, Yeah I mean  I think it would take levels that we cant comprehend since the Nixon era, and I dont think we should get too far ahead because it hasnt happened.
