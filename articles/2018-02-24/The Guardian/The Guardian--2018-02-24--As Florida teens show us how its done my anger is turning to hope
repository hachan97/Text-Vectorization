Its hard to imagine finding light and hope in the aftermath of a tragedy like the one that left 17 people dead in Parkland, Florida. Yet somehow we have, thanks to the sheer determination of student survivors. Theyre flooding cable television and social media, starting walkouts and marches. Even better, theyre fighting back against rightwing smears with the kind of online savvy that only young people have.

Now if we could just do half as much for them as theyre doing for this country ...

Thanks to pressure by the young people in Parkland, three rental car companies have ended their relationships with the NRA. Fingers crossed for more to come.

Michael Ian Black on the way we are failing boys; a doctor who treated Parkland victims talks about what kind of damage bullets do to young bodies; and Jamelle Bouie on how arming teachers would put students of color in danger.

On one of the most nefarious lies the NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch told at CNNs town hall.

This week Im more hopeful than angry. Watching teenagers take apart politicians with ease, seeing how theyre turning their grief into action  its the first time in a long while that Ive thought maybe things will start to get better.
