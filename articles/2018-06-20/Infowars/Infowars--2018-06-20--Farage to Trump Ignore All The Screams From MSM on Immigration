President Trump must ignore the lefts outrage over his tough immigration policy or else his supporters wont vote for him again, according to Brexit architect Nigel Farage.

Immigration led to the Brexit vote, immigration led to new Italian government, immigration will finish off Angela Merkel and President Trump was elected on a very tough ticket of dealing with illegal immigration, Farage said on Fox & Friends on Wednesday. And now youve got the liberal media screaming at everything he does.

Farage warned that if Trump caves to the left that many of his supporters wont come out to vote for him again in 2020.

But the one things for certain  if Trump does not hold true and really tighten immigration, many of those people who came out and voted for him wont do it again, he said.

Its very easy to be compassionate, but youve got to understand in the case of America and these borders, many of the children are actually being used as means to get other people in, many of whom arent even their families.

Trump has got to stay tough on this and ignore all the screams coming from the liberal media, he added.

As the Russian witch hunt disintegrates, the left has latched onto Trumps immigration actions to drum up fear and anger within their base in hopes theyll show up to vote in the midterms in a much-hyped blue wave.
