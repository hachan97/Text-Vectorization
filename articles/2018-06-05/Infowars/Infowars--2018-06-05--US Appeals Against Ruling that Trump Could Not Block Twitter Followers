The U.S. Justice Department said on Monday it would appeal against a federal judges ruling that President Donald Trump may not legally block Twitter users from his account on the social media platform based on their political views, according to a court filing.

Jameel Jaffer, a lawyer for the seven plaintiffs who sued, said the @realDonaldTrump account had unblocked the seven plaintiffs on Monday.

Were pleased that the White House unblocked our clients from the Presidents Twitter account but disappointed that the government intends to appeal the district courts thoughtful and well-supported ruling, Jaffer said in an email.

The White House did not comment immediately. A Justice Department spokeswoman confirmed the plaintiffs had been unblocked.
