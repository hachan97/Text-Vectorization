US President Donald Trump has pardoned boxing's first black heavyweight champ, who was convicted in 1913 of taking his white girlfriend across state lines.

Joined in the Oval Office by actor Sylvester Stallone and boxer Lennox Lewis, Mr Trump said the move corrected a historic US wrong to Jack Johnson.

Johnson was arrested in 1912 with Lucille Cameron, a white woman who would later become his wife.

He was world heavyweight title holder from 1908 until 1915.

Mr Trump shook hands with current and former heavyweight champions at the White House during the announcement of the full pardon on Thursday.

Linda Bell Haywood, the maternal great-great niece of Jack Johnson, was also present.

"I've issued an executive grant of clemency, a full pardon posthumously to Jack Johnson, the first African American heavyweight champion of the world," Mr Trump said.

"He served 10 months for what many view as a racially motivated injustice."

Mr Trump had said he was considering pardoning Johnson back in April, after Mr Stallone brought the case to his attention.

"Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson," Mr Trump said last month on Twitter.

"His trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial."

Johnson is a boxing legend. Born in Galveston, Texas, he became the first African American to win the world heavyweight crown in 1908, defeating Tommy Burns.

He would hold on to that title until 1915.

In 1910, when Johnson defeated "great white hope" Jim Jeffries in the so-called Fight of the Century in Reno, Nevada, race riots erupted across the nation claiming more than 20 lives.

His story was dramatised for Pulitzer Prize-winning play The Great White Hope, starring James Earl Jones in 1969.
