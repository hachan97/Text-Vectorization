Following last weeks deadly shooting at a high school near Houston that left 10 people dead, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Wednesday that he could support some gun control measures.

The move is something of a change of heart for Abbott, a Republican who has worked to expand gun rights in Texas.

Earlier this year, Abbott had backed President Donald Trumps proposal to arm more teachers in lieu of sweeping gun control measures, saying that almost 20 percent of Texas schools already have trained and armed educators.

When a shooting takes place, people want to rush to simple solutions, Abbott said in February, after a mass shooting at a Florida high school that killed 17. Its time to tackle the tough solutions, and thats mental health.
