Hours after President Trump canceled his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Trumps administration hinted that it might ratchet up sanctions against his country.

A senior White House official told reporters on Thursday that the administrations goal is to achieve maximum pressure on Kims government using sanctions, and that were still short of that.

Its like painting the Golden Gate Bridge, the senior administration official said. It starts peeling as soon as you finish, and so you have to keep a new coat of paint going just to maintain a certain level of pressure.

The Trump administration has pursued sanctions as a pressure tactic to try to persuade Kim to halt his nuclear weapon and ballistic missile testing. At the United Nations, the US has successfully gotten multiple rounds of harsh sanctions passed, including a resolution in December that makes it harder for North Korea to import fuel and sell food to foreign countries.

Its possible that additional sanctions  if powerful enough  could anger Kim and make a future summit less likely. And every time tensions between the US and North Korea rise, the likelihood of war breaking out between the two countries rises as well.
