White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders trolled The Washington Post after the far-left outlet consulted a facial recognition expert to analyze Chief of Staff John Kellys terse facial expression during President Trumps NATO meeting.

WaPo had written a hit piece twisting President Trumps words about Germanys dependence on Russian natural gas, and requested a comment about Kelly pursing his lips tightly over the remarks.

Sanders only had this to say:

In a statement to The Post, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, [Kelly] was displeased because he was expecting a full breakfast and there were only pastries and cheese,' WaPo reporter Robert Costa tweeted Wednesday.

The left, of course, couldnt handle her trolling of WaPos completely dishonest article accusing Trump of attacking Germany.

So were supposed to protect you against Russia but theyre paying billions of dollars to Russia and I think thats very in inappropriate, Trump told NATO leaders.

Theyll say wait a minute were supposed to be protecting you from Russia but why are you paying billions of dollars to Russia for energy? Why are countries in NATO, namely Germany having a large percentage of their energy needs paid to Russia and taken care of by Russia?

Germany as far as I am concerned is captive to Russia ... were supposed to protect Germany while they are getting their energy from Russia, explain that, Trump once again asked the NATO Secretary General.
