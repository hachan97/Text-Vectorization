The reports sounded dire. Former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort had been jailed last month after a judge ruled he violated his conditions of release while awaiting trial and now, his lawyers wrote, he had been housed in solitary confinement in the Northern Neck Regional Jail. Manafort was locked in his cell for at least 23 hours per day (excluding visits from his attorneys).

But a new filing by special counsel Robert Muellers team makes Manaforts time behind bars seem ... well, not quite so bad as all that might make you think.

Over the past week, reports based solely on the word of Manaforts lawyers prompted a flurry of commentary about the allegedly horrendous mistreatment hes been suffering. Solitary confinement is basically a deathtrap, former New York City police commissioner (and convicted felon) Bernard Kerik wrote. A 12 x 8 solid steel or concrete box with a metal bed, stainless steel sink and toilet, and if youre lucky, a small concrete or metal writing table and stool.

Other conservative commentators also weighed in:

Even some who are not at all fans of Trump or Manafort weighed in to criticize the practice as a policy. Solitary confinement is still torture, Splinter Newss Katherine Krueger wrote, even if its happening to Paul Manafort.

However, Muellers new filing, if accurate, reveals that the Manafort version of solitary confinement comes with certain amenities.

Whether all this is akin to waterboarding or a strategy to torture Manafort into madness, Ill leave for others to decide.

But whatever the conditions currently are, Manaforts situation is about to change. On Wednesday, Judge T.S. Ellis III ordered him moved from his current jail in rural Warsaw, Virginia to a detention center in Alexandria, Virginia, to await his trial. That trial  the first of two Manafort will face  is scheduled to begin in just two weeks, on July 25.
