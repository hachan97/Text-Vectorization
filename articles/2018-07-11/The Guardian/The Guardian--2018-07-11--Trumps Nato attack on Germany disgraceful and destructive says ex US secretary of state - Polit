In Scotland politicians, police and protesters continue to struggle to pin down precisely what is happening when the US President arrives in Scotland.

Although it has been confirmed that the UK governments Scottish secretary David Mundell will greet Donald Trump when he arrives near Glasgow on Friday, it is understood that no members of the Scottish government will be present, nor will Trump meet the first minster of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, who has been a vocal critic of his policies in the past.

It appears that Trumps stay at his luxury resort in Turnberry, on the west coast, will be an entirely private visit, as he prepares for his meeting in Finland with Putin.

Although there are rumours of ad hoc protests around the Turnberry resort, the main demonstrations on Friday evening and Saturday afternoon will be happening in Glasgow and then Edinburgh.

Yesterday Scotlands justice secretary Humza Yousaf voiced frustration felt by politicians and the police as he called for further clarity around Trumps as police struggle to organise the 5m security operation with limited forewarning. He urged those wanting to protest against the US Presidents visit to do so safely and peacefully.
