A man who had already been deported three times from the U.S. is facing a child sexual assault charge in Cleveland, Ohio.

Antonio Barrera from Mexico has been accused of sexually assaulting a child relative on Clevelands east side in December 2017, reported Fox 8, citing police. Felony sex charges against Barrera are now pending in Cuyahoga County Court.

The victims mother told Fox 8 on Thursday, April 5, that Barrera had been living with them and that all his relatives knew about his past.

Yes, we all knew he didnt have papers, the woman said. She did not want to be identified.
