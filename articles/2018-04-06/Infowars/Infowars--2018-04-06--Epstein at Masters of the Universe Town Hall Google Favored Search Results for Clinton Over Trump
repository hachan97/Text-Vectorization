Robert Epstein, a senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, claimed during Breitbart News Masters of the Universe town hall tonight that Google favored positive search results of Hillary Clinton above those of President Trump.

Epstein discussed his work surrounding the power of tech companies on elections and their influence on voters saying, I have been studying for more than five years with controlled experiments around the world, four national elections, tens of thousands of people. Ive been studying exactly how many votes or opinions Google can change, Google can shift, just by them manipulating those search results when we type in a search term and they give us a list.

It turns out that whats at the top of the list, said Epstein, people believe is better and truer than whats lower in the list, thats why 50 percent of the clicks go to the top two items. Epstein continued, so it turns out we showed in our studies that if you favor one candidate in search results, so maybe higher ranked results make that candidate look better, you click on it, it takes you to a webpage that makes that candidate look really good, if you favor one candidate in search results among voters who are undecided you can easily shift at least 20 percent of them towards that candidate, up to 80 percent. And at least one demographic group that we found and the most vulnerable group that weve ever found in our five years of studies, is moderate Republicans.
