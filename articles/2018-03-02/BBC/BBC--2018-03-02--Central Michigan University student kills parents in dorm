Police in the US state of Michigan are hunting a student who shot and killed his parents when they came to pick him up for spring break, US media report.

James Eric Davis Jr reportedly gunned down his mother and father in his dormitory a day after he went to hospital for a drug-related issue.

The victims are Diva Davis, 47, and James Eric Davis Sr, 48, according to television station WILX.

They were shot on the fourth floor of Campbell Hall, according to police.

An Illinois state lawmaker said on Twitter that the family permanently resided in the Chicago area, where Mr Davis Sr had served as a policeman until his death.

Local police did not confirm the victims were Mr Davis' parents but said that the two individuals killed were not faculty, staff or students of the university.

Police warned locals to continue to take shelter as the suspect is still at large.

The 20,000-student college - which is located two hours northwest of Detroit, Michigan - confirmed the fatalities on Twitter on Friday morning.

The school is a gun-free zone and does not permit weapons on campus.

Police said they were in contact with 19-year-old second-year student Mr Davis last night when he was taken to a nearby hospital for an alleged drug-related incident.

Mr Davis is believed to have left the hospital before going to campus where the shooting took place.

Cameras captured the suspect exiting the north side of the residence hall and running along the railroad, police Lt Larry Klaus said.

He was wearing a blue jumper at the time of the shooting but articles of clothing were found strewn along the railroad tracks, according to police.

Officials from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are en route, they said on Twitter.

A student group tweeted photos of the scene, including a bomb squad vehicle that arrived on campus, after the incident.

The campus is still on lockdown.
