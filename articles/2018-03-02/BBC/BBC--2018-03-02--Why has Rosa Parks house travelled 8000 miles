Three years ago, Rosa Parkss house was on the demolition list. Then an American artist stepped forward and saved it.

Ryan Mendoza shipped it from Detroit, Michigan, to Berlin in Germany.

This week the house made its way back across the Atlantic to America's East Coast, where it is to go on display at Brown University.
