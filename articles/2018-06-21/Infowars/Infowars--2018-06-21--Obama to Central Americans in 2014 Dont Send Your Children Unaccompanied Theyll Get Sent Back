President Obama forcefully told Central American parents in 2014 not to send their children unaccompanied to America.

Our message absolutely is dont send your children unaccompanied, on trains or through a bunch of smugglers, Obama told ABCs George Stephanopoulos. We dont even know how many of these kids dont make it, and may have been waylaid into sex trafficking or killed because they fell off a train, we have no way of tracking that.

That is our direct message to the families in Central America: do not send your children to the borders, Obama said. If they do make it, theyll get sent back. More importantly, they may not make it.

According to Democrats and establishment Republicans in 2018, sending your child unaccompanied to be exploited by sex traffickers and drug and human smugglers is an act of love.

A Fusion investigation claimed 80 percent of women and girls crossing into the U.S. by way of Mexico are raped during their journey, The Huffington Post reported in 2014. Thats up from a previous estimate of 60 percent, according to an Amnesty International report.

These Mexican rapists can thank the Democrats for keeping their raping, smuggling, drug-importing racket going with their endless crying stunts!
