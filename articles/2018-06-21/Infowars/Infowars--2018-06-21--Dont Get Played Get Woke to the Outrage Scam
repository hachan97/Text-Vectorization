So what are we supposed to be outraged about today?

Theres always something, and its always the worst thing in the history of ever. And its almost always a scam designed to manipulate you into obeying the liberal elite. Thats the real outrage.

Whats the latest? Kids in cages, separated from their moms! Oh no! That only happens to every other criminal ever. Well, every American criminal ever.
