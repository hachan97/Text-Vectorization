Florida law enforcement officials arrested a man on Thursday who allegedly called the office of Rep. Brian Mast (R-FL) and threatened to kill his kids over the medias recent hysteria over the child-separation immigration policy.

Laurence Key, who is accused of calling Masts office 478 times, allegedly told an intern at Masts office, Im going to find the congressmans kids and kill them, The TC Palm reported.

Key continued, allegedly saying, If you are going to separate kids at the border, Im going to kill his kids.

Dont try to find me because you wont, Key added.

After being arrested, Key allegedly told investigators that he never threatened to hurt Masts children, but said, Mast should be separated from his kids.

Keys social media pages show he is very politically active, WPTV noted. He volunteers regularly for the Democratic Party of Martin County and has volunteered many hours for Planned Parenthood, according to a friend of Keys.

The TC Palm notes that authorities federally charged Key with communication of a threat to kidnap or injure a person.

Mast has a daughter and two sons who are under the age of eight.
