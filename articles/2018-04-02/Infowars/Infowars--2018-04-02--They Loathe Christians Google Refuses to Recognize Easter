Google had a doodle for the Hindu Holi religious festival one month ago.

Here it is on their own website.

Why is Google lying about this?

Google has refused to recognize Easter by failing to devote a doodle to the Christian holiday despite commemorating numerous other obscure events and people, leading actor James Woods to remark, they loathe Christians.

According to Wikipedia, A Google Doodle is a special, temporary alteration of the logo on Googles homepages that commemorates holidays, events, achievements, and people.

Google has previously devoted a doodle to Yuri Kochiyama, a Communist activist who once said she admired Osama Bin Laden, to recognize her would-be 95th birthday.

While occasionally ignoring Veterans Day and Memorial Day, the Silicon Valley giant routinely devotes doodles to Islamic figures and Hindu holidays. Googles Christmas doodle has also routinely omitted Christ or any Christian related symbolism.

Over Easter Sunday and again today, there is nothing whatsoever on Googles home page to commemorate the Christian festival.

So Google has a doodle for every obscure woke person/event imaginable, but nothing for Easter? I tweeted.

Google has devoted a doodle to all manner of obscure, far-left events and progressive icons, and fringe religious commemorations, but apparently Easter isnt important enough to be celebrated with even a rabbit or an egg.
