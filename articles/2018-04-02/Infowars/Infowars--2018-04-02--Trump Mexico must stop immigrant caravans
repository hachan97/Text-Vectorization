President Trump early Monday pressed Mexico to stop immigrant caravans trying to reach the United States.

Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large Caravans of people enter their country, Trump wrote on Twitter.

They must stop them at their Northern Border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws.....

Trump on Sunday referenced caravans of people entering the United States in a tweet on Sunday following a segment on Fox & Friends that discussed an army of immigrants marching from Honduras.
