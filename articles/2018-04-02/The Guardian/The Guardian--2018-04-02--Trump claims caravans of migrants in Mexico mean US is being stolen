Donald Trump returned to the offensive on immigration on Monday, repeating a claim that caravans of migrants from Central America are threatening to enter the US via Mexico and demanding: Act now Congress, our country is being stolen!

Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large Caravans of people enter their country, the president tweeted. They must stop them at their Northern Border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws.

Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People. Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT, but the weak Dem laws dont allow them to do their job. Act now Congress, our country is being stolen!

Trumps use of the term caravans  also made in a sequence of tweets on Easter Sunday  was a reference to a large group of people who are heading through Mexico, hoping to reach the US border. A reporter from BuzzFeed has been with them.



For five days now, Adolfo Flores reported on Friday, hundreds of Central Americans  children, women and men, most of them from Honduras  have boldly crossed immigration checkpoints, military bases, and police in a desperate, sometimes chaotic march toward the United States. Despite their being in Mexico without authorization, no one has made any effort to stop them.

The caravan has been reported on by Fox News, Trumps preferred cable network.

Mexicos National Immigration Institute said it would issue a statement on the caravan later on Monday.

The nuclear option Trump refers to would be a reform of Senate rules to allow major legislation to pass with 51 votes rather than the current 60. The Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has shown no sign of acceding to Trumps repeated demand.

Organizers said some 1,300 people were participating in the caravan, which is currently traversing the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in the southern state of Oaxaca.

Mexican immigration officials routinely detain and deport hundreds of thousands of Central Americans, who in recent years have streamed north to escape horrific violence in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

The migrants paths through Mexico are perilous. Criminal gangs, often acting in cahoots with crooked public officials, prey upon migrants, often extorting them or kidnapping them for ransom.

Shelters run the length of the country, offering migrants a place to eat, rest and wash and tend to their wounds as they head north. The operators of these shelters expressed wariness with the caravan currently winding its way through southern Mexico, saying such attempts at moving migrants through Mexico often turn into targets for criminal groups.

Jorge Andrade, a spokesperson for the shelters, says polleros human smugglers and other organized crime members infiltrated the caravan. People pretending to be migrants, meanwhile, joined in and started extorting actual migrants.

Its a real logistical challenge, in addition to security questions, Andrade said. During a 2014 caravan that Andrade accompanied, we realized that we had been infiltrated by people from organized crime, who we could identify.

Many of the participants in caravans inevitably are offered humanitarian visas, which allow them to temporarily remain in Mexico, or they file asylum applications.

Organizers of the Caravana Viacrucis Migrantes-Refugiados were not available to comment.

On Monday, Trump widened his attack, tweeting: DACA is dead because the Democrats didnt care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon ... No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime!

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or Daca, was an Obama-era programme which shielded undocumented migrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers, from the threat of deportation.

Trump announced the cancellation of Daca last year. No replacement has been instituted but court orders have maintained protections for recipients.

Trump claimed on Sunday that a lot of people are coming in because they want to take advantage of Daca, and were going to have to really see.

In fact, to be eligible for Daca, applicants must have lived in the US continually since 15 June 2007 and come to the country before their 16th birthday. Applicants must also either be in school, or have graduated high school, or have been honourably discharged from the US military or coast guard.

Trumps decision to quash any remaining hopes of a Daca deal drew criticism on Sunday. John Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio who is seen as a possible primary challenger to Trump in 2020, tweeted: A true leader preserves & offers hope, doesnt take hope from innocent children who call America home. Remember, today is Easter Sunday.

Trump rejected one deal with Democrats that would have funded a border wall, which he promised throughout his campaign for the White House would be paid for by Mexico. He has recently suggested the military could pay for the wall, a prospect experts said was extremely unlikely.

Later on Monday, Trump returned to the North American Free Trade Agreement, a favourite target which in his Sunday tweets he had threatened to stop. Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA, he wrote, adding: With all of the money they make from the US, hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours, at least until Congress changes our immigration laws!

Polls in Mexico show people south of the border support Nafta, but dont see themselves as big winners from the trade deal, which also includes Canada.

Regarding possible motives for Trumps latest outburst, which also took in Amazon, NBC and CNN, news outlets reported White House sources as saying Trump has been told his base thinks he has softened on immigration.

The president has also been beset by damaging stories, from developments in special counsel Robert Muellers investigation of Russian election interference and alleged collusion between Trump aides and Moscow, to adult film actor Stormy Daniels claim that she had an affair with the billionaire in 2006.

Controversies over ethics and spending are affecting members of the Trump administration, including housing and urban development secretary Ben Carson and Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt.

On Sunday the former Veterans Affairs secretary David Shulkin told network television he was fired last week, rather than resigning as the White House claimed. Shulkin, who opposed the privatisation of VA operations, blamed political appointees for his downfall.
