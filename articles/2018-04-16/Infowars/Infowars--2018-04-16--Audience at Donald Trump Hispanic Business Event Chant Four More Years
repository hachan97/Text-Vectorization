Attendees at President Donald Trumps roundtable event on tax cuts appeared to like what they heard after the president visited Hialeah, Florida.

Some in the group shouted four more years! as the president concluded his event.

A group of Hispanic business leaders spoke at the event, praising the presidents latest tax cuts for helping them boost their businesses, create jobs, and offer more benefits to employees.

Trump was joined by leaders of gas stations, a transportation company, a dentistry, a restaurant chain, a craft brewing company, and a community bank.
