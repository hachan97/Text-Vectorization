Former FBI Director James Comey told ABC News in his interview aired Sunday night that his entire family were passionate supporters of Hillary Clinton for President and his wife said she cried the night Trump won.

My wife and girls marched in the Womens March the day after President Trumps inauguration, James Comey told ABCs George Stephanopoulos.

At least my four daughters, probably all five of my kids, wanted Hillary Clinton to be the first woman president, he said. I know my amazing spouse did.

I wanted a woman president really badly, and I supported Hillary Clinton, Comeys wife Patrice Comey told Stephanopoulos. A lot of my friends worked for her. And I was devastated when she lost.

I just cant even imagine the pain shes gone through. I cried Election Day. I went on the Womens March the day after the inauguration. And Im hoping for a woman in 2020, Patrice Comey said.

Comey claimed throughout the interview he was totally impartial, but then said he thinks Trumps a serial liar, morally unfit to be president, a stain on everyone who works around him and treats women like meat.

The most striking aspect of the interview was the way Comey doesnt seem to have any comprehension of the fact hes living in a bubble in Washington DC where Trump only got 4 percent of the vote and Hillary got 91 percent.
