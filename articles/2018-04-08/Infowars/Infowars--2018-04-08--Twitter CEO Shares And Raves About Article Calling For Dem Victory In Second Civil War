Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey aroused controversy after labeling a Medium article great that claimed theres no bipartisan way forward in the United States and that the country is engaged in a fundamental conflict between two worldviews that must be resolved in short order.

Dorsey shared the Medium article on his personal Twitter account Thursday night, with the accompanying acclaim that it was a great read.

Author and media consultant Peter Leyden and political commentator Ruy Teixeira argued in the article titled The Great Lesson of California in Americas New Civil War that America is already in the midst of a second major domestic conflict of sorts and the way out is for the rest of the country to imitate California.

In this current period of American politics, at this juncture in our history, theres no way that a bipartisan path provides the way forward, they wrote. The way forward is on the path California blazed about 15 years ago.
