Hillary Clinton attended a Memorial Day parade in Chappaqua, New York Monday, and once again she wore a heavy coat and a scarf in summer weather while an unknown object bulged out of her back.

In the video below, an attendee caught footage of the strange bump as the Clintons walked by.

Many Twitter users pointed out the odd protrusion and some claimed it was a back brace.

This isnt the first time Hillary has been seen wearing oversized coats in hot temperatures in the last few weeks.

On Friday, Clinton was spotted in a long jacket and scarf while it was nearly 90 degrees in Boston.

At the beginning of May, Hillary was clearly wearing something underneath her coat in the 80-degree Manhattan sunshine.

Will Hillary be able to continue wearing large coats and scarfs throughout the summer months without passing out or falling like she has done in the past?
