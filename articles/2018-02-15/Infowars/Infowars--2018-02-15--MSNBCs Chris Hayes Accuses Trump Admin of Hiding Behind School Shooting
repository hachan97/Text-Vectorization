MSNBCs Chris Hayes bizarrely accused the Trump administration of hiding behind the deadly school shooting in Florida before hastily deleting his tweet.

Is the WH really hiding behind a school shooting so they dont have to answer questions about a host scandals in the administration? Kinda looks like thats whats happening, tweeted the All In host.

Hayes was presumably referring to the fact that White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cancelled a planned press briefing in response to the shooting.

Sanders was set to take questions about former White House staff secretary Rob Porters security clearance. Porter resigned from his position after domestic abuse allegations from both his ex-wives.

ABC News also suggested a link between the school shooting and the Porter scandal during live coverage of the horrific incident in Florida, with a reporter asserting that the White House was in turmoil over the issue.

We are expecting a briefing in the hour from Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, said Cecilia Vega. And of course, as you know, George, this very tragic incident comes as this White House is in turmoil right now over this with this Rob Porter scandal.

USA Today White House correspondent Gregory Korte called the cancellation of the press conference extraordinary.

Just think how terrible of a person you must be to be complaining about there being no WH press briefing to ask Sanders about Rob Porter when theres people lying dead inside a Florida high school, commented Newsbusters Curtis Houck.

Reporters are also complaining that there is no White House press briefing scheduled for today.
