Some Colorado state lawmakers say if Congress wont reform the immigration system, they will.

Legislation is under discussion in the state Capitol to give Colorado its own version of a green card.

Our sister station in Denver reports the bill would allow anyone who has paid state taxes for at least two years and has not had a felony in three years to be eligible for legal status.

This would make Colorado the first state in the country with its own legal work permit.
