U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday accused Mexico of doing nothing to stop illegal immigrants crossing into the United States, and repeated his election campaign pledge that Mexico would pay for his planned border wall.

Very quickly Mexico replied: no we wont.

Trump was addressing supporters in a campaign-style rally in Nashville, Tennessee when he returned to the wall he wants built on the U.S. southern border to keep out illegal immigrants.
