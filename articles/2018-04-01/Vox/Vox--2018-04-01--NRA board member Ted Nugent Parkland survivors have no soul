Ted Nugent, a National Rifle Association (NRA) board member and rock musician, became the latest to lob personal attacks at the teenage Parkland, Florida, shooting survivors who organized the March for Our Lives  saying that the kids are liars, poor, mushy-brained children, and even soulless during an interview on March 30 with The Joe Pags Show, a nationally syndicated conservative radio show.

All you have to do now is not only feel sorry for the liars, but you have to go against them and pray to God that the lies can be crushed and the liars can be silenced so that real measures can be put into place to actually save childrens lives, Nugent said.

Many conservatives have been critical of the Parkland survivors political beliefs, which isnt too surprising given that they generally want gun control. But some, like Nugent, have gone further than that  attacking the kids for unrelated and often personal aspects of their lives.

On the radio show, Nugent claimed that the left had lied to the Parkland students, which he said meant they were committing spiritual suicide.

To attack the good, law-abiding families of America when well-known, predictable murderers commit these horrors is deep in the category of soulless, Nugent continued. These poor children  Im afraid to say and it hurts me to say this, but the evidence is irrefutable  they have no soul.

Its not unusual for politics to get personal, though its particularly glaring when prominent pundits and even lawmakers are going after teenagers in such a personal way. But Nugents comments arent a one-off incident  theyre part of a broader campaign of politically motivated character assassination.
