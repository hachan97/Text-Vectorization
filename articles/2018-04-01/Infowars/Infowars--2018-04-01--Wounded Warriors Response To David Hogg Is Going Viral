Wounded warrior Derek Weida, who lost a leg while deployed in Iraq, posted a poignant rebuttal to Parkland survivor David Hoggs gun control campaign on Friday.

As of Saturday afternoon, Weidas post had over 35,000 reactions and over 14,000 shares.

The post was written from the perspective of Weida listening to David Hogg speak, and it began with a direct piece of advice for Hogg: Watch what you say.

I got shot on a house raid in Iraq. My getting shot didnt make me a professional on war, international relations, house raids (obviously!), or guns, wrote Weida, adding that despite the horrible thing that happened to him  and the feelings he had against the war in Iraq  he didnt come home and protest the war.

Acknowledging that he signed up to be shot at as opposed to Parkland students, Waida had a few words to say about gun control.
