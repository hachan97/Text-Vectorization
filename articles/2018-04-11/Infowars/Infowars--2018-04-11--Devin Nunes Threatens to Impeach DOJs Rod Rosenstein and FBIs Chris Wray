The top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee says he is prepared to impeach the head of the FBI and Deputy Attorney General if he doesnt get a two-page document he says prompted the Russia investigation.

Just the fact that theyre not giving this to us tells me theres something wrong here, California Republican Rep. Devin Nunes told Fox News host Laura Ingraham on the The Ingraham Angle Tuesday night.

I can tell you that were not just going to hold in contempt, we will have a plan to hold in contempt and to impeach, Nunes told Ingraham, who asked what his committee would do to FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein if they dont bow to his demand.

The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee has been seeking an unredacted version of the document which marked the beginning and formal basis of the FBIs investigation of the Trump campaign on allegations it aided Russias interference in the 2016 election.
