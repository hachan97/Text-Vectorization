President Donald Trump considered firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller in December 2017 after the publication of news stories that turned out to be inaccurate.

Trump told advisers to fire Mueller following reports the special counsels office subpoenaed his bank records from Deutsche Bank, according to The New York Times. Trump believed the subpoenas crossed a red line he had set for the Mueller probe, which initially began as an investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government.

Trump ordered Muellers firing at least one other time. Trump demanded White House counsel Don McGahn fire Mueller in June 2017 because the president believed the special counsels prosecutors and investigators were politically biased, The Times previously reported. But Trump backed down after McGahn threatened to resign.

The stories about the Deutsche Bank subpoenas, which appeared in The Wall Street Journal, Reuters and Bloomberg on Dec. 5, turned out to be inaccurate. The outlets issued a correction noting the subpoenas were for bank records of Trump associates.
