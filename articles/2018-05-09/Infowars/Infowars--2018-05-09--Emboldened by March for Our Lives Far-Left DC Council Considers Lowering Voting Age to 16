D.C. Public Schools announced April 28 that just 46 percent of seniors in the Districts traditional high schools are on track to graduate in June.

Not to worry, however: The D.C. Council isnt likely to let that minor detail stand in the way of allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to vote.

Theres a reason the Republican-controlled Congress hasnt relinquished its role as a backstop on the excesses of D.C. home rule, as Democrats would like it to. Simply put, its because theres no liberal idea too outlandish for the D.C. Council, which is a Republican-free zone with 11 Democrats and two nominal independents.

The latest example is the notion of lowering the voting age in the city to 16, and apparently there now is majority support for it on the 13-member D.C. Council.
