Drudge Report chief Matt Drudge criticized President Trump on Wednesday for his threat to take away credentials from news outlets.

I fear the future result of Trumps crusade on fake news will be a licensing of all reporters, said Drudge, who typically deletes his tweets shortly after posting them.

The mop-up on this issue is going to be excruciating..., he added.

Drudge, who is largely supportive of the president, added that Senate Democrats had floated such an idea before Trump was president.
