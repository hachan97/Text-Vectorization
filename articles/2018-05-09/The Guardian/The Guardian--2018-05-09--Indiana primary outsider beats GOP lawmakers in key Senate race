An outsider, Mike Braun, beat two US congressmen in Indianas Republican Senate primary and will face the incumbent Democrat Joe Donnelly in what is expected to be one of the most competitive races of the 2018.

Trump won Indiana by almost 20 points, and Republicans there have long targeted Donnelly. The president will appear at a campaign stop there on Thursday along with Vice-President Mike Pence.



Braun, a businessman, won a decisive victory over the US representatives Luke Messer and Todd Rokita by attacking the congressmen as identical creatures of the Washington swamp.

Meanwhile, both Rokita and Messer tried to closely tie themselves to Trump; Messer nominated Trump for the Nobel peace prize while Rokita campaigned with a cardboard cutout of him.



Greg Pence, Mikes older brother, easily won the primary for the safe Republican seat vacated by Messer.



The marquee race for Democrats on Tuesday was the Ohio gubernatorial primary, where the former presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich flopped in a comeback attempt against Richard Cordray, the former head of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB). Cordray was strongly backed by Elizabeth Warren, who campaigned for him in the state.

Kucinich, a former congressman, faced scrutiny over his ties to the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and his refusal to condemn the Assad regime. Democrats were worried that Kucinichs baggage could drag the rest of the ticket down if he were the partys nominee.

Cordray will face Mike DeWine, a former US senator and the states current attorney general. DeWine easily defeated a primary challenge from the states lieutenant governor, Mary Taylor.

In Ohios Republican primary for US Senate, Jim Renacci, an incumbent congressman who was vocally supported by Trump, is ahead of the businessman Mike Gibbons for the Republican nomination. Renacci will face an uphill fight in November against Sherrod Brown, a two-term incumbent senator in the swing state.
