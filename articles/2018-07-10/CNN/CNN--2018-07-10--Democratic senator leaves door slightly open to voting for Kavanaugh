In an interview with CNN's Alisyn Camerota on "New Day" Tuesday morning, Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, discussed whether she would vote against the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, the President's nominee to the high court to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy.

"The burden of the proof is on him, which means that I am leaning no but maybe he can convince me to vote for him," she said. "This is a big burden on him to show me he can be fair and objective."

Hirono's comments come in contrast to what other Senate Democrats have said of the nominee. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer D-New York, tweeted Monday that he will "oppose Judge Kavanaugh's nomination with everything I have, and I hope a bipartisan majority will do the same."
