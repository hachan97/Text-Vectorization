Despite relentless media hysteria, a demonstration to protest against President Trumps Supreme Court pick drew relatively few people.

During an appearance on Bill Mahers show last month, far-left film maker Michael Moore said he would join a million other people surrounding the United States Capitol to prevent the Supreme Court nominee from being confirmed.

That figure is looking somewhat optimistic given the turnout last night.

Conservative comedian Tim Young tweeted an image to show just how few people are protesting at #SCOTUS right now...

Im sure the media angles make it look like thousands... it might be 300, he added.

The numbers were poor given how much anger far-left groups like Media Matters, RefuseFascism and the Womens March have been attempting to whip up since Justice Anthony Kennedy announced he would be retiring almost two weeks ago.

Indeed, the George Soros-backed groups made sure to print signs for every possible nominee, safe in the knowledge that whoever Trump picked, theyd definitely be part of the ongoing Nazi takeover of the United States.

Hilariously, the Womens March released a statement about Trumps nominee before they even knew who it was, forgetting to add Brett Kavanaughs before the text was sent out.

The relatively small crowd of people who showed up to scream helplessly at the sky did make time to verbally abuse Fox News reporter Shannon Bream, using sexist language to call her a blonde bimbo, because its totally fine and not misogyny at all when they do it.
