Students across the country are walking out of their schools and universities on March 14 to demand gun law reform and honor the lives of the 17 people killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, exactly one month ago.

Most walkouts will take place at 10 am local time in each location and last 17 minutes: one minute for each of the victims at Stoneman Douglas.

More than 2,500 walkouts are planned nationwide (and a few internationally), but the protests look different at every school. Some organized a lie-in  a form of protest in which participants simulate being dead  while others will hold rallies, according to an interview that Womens March youth coordinator Tabitha St. Bernard Jacobs gave to ABC.

While many school districts have been supportive of the protests, some schools have reportedly threatened to punish students participating in walkouts.

Here are some images from events around the country. Well be updating this post throughout the day as more walkouts occur.
