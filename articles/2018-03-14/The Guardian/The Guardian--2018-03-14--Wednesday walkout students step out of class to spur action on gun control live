As students staged walkout across the country to demand on the one month anniversary of the deaths of 17 people at a high school Florida, lawmakers in Washington took a modest step aimed at preventing violence in classrooms  but did not address demands for stricter gun control.



The House voted on Wednesday to pass legislation, known as the STOP School Violence Act, which would authorize $50m dollars for campus safety improvements, including training for local law enforcement and faculty and the development of an anonymous reporting system to identify early warning signs of potential threats.

The bill, drafted by Representative John Rutherford, a Republican from Florida, passed the chamber 407 to 10. The Senate is considering a similar measure, introduced by Utah Republican Orrin Hatch.
