With all but two out of 593 precincts reporting, Democrat Conor Lamb clings to an 847 vote lead over Republican Rick Saccone in the special election in Pennsylvanias 18th Congressional District.

Lamb has 111,875 votes to Saccones 111,028 votes, according to the Pennsylvania Secretary of States website as of 11:30 p.m. Tuesday.

Allegheny Countys absentee ballots are included in that count, but the absentee ballots in the three other counties in the district have yet to be counted: 1,195 in Washington County, 1,808 in Westmoreland County, and 203 in Greene County, for a total of 3,204 absentee ballots yet to be counted.

To pull out the victory, Saccone will need to get a little over 60 percent of these ballots.
