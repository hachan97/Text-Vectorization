Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Wednesday addressed a crowd of students in Washington, D.C., participating in the national walkout to protest gun violence.

Speaking through a megaphone outside the Capitol, Sanders commended the students for leading the nation in the right direction and opposing the National Rifle Association (NRA).

We are very proud of what you are doing, the former presidential candidate said. You, the young people of this country, are leading the nation.
