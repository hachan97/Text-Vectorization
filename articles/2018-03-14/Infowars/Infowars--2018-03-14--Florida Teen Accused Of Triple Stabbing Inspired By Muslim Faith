A Florida teenager is accused of murdering a 13-year-old boy and injuring two others in a stabbing attack, which he said was because of his Muslim faith.

Local media reports that 17-year-old Corey Johnson will face charges of first-degree murder after officers attended a scene in Palm Beach Gardens on Monday where 13-year-old Jovanni Brand was dead, while mother Elaine Simon and her 13-year-old son Dane Bancroft were also found suffering from stab wounds.

According to local police, Johnson was attending a sleepover at a friends house, when around 4 a.m. he decided to carry out the attack while other guests were asleep.

Johnson advised at 4 a.m. he realized that everyone in the house was asleep, wrote Officer Jennifer Brashear in a probable cause affidavit. At that time, Johnson made the decision to kill Elaine, Dane, and Jovanni in their sleep.
