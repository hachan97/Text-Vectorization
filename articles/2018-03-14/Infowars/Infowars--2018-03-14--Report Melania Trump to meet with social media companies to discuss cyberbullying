First lady Melania Trump will meet with social media and tech companies next week to talk about how to combat cyberbullying and promote online safety.

The Washington Post reported Tuesday that the meeting is planned for March 20, and will include Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Amazon, and Google.

Trump plans to ask the companies how theyve addressed online trolls and the spread of malicious content, but she doesnt plan to roll out policy proposals to fight cyberbullying  an issue she pledged to combat before her husband won the election.

Trump has spent little time publicly addressing the issue while shes been first lady. However, she encouraged positive social media habits among children and teens during a speech to the spouses of the nations governors last month.
