President Trump took to Twitter early Sunday to blast the White House Correspondents Association dinner, claiming the event was a very big, boring bust.

While Washington, Michigan, was a big success, Washington, D.C., just didnt work, Trump said, referring to a rally he held instead of attending the dinner Saturday night.

The president also said that entertainer Michelle Wolf really bombed during her routine at the dinner, calling her a so-called comedian and saying that Fox News host Greg Gutfeld should host the event next year.

Wolf took direct aim at the Trump administration throughout her routine at the dinner, including the president himself.

Trump isnt here, if you havent noticed. Hes not here, Wolf said. And I know, I know, I would drag him here myself, but it turns out the president of the United States is the one pussy youre not allowed to grab.
