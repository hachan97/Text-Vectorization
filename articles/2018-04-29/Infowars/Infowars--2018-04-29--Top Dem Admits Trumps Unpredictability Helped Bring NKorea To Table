It couldnt have been easy, but Rep. Adam Schiff, California Democrat, offered praise Sunday to President Trump for convincing North Korea to enter into negotiations on its nuclear weapons program.

I think its more than fair to say that the combination of the presidents unpredictability and indeed his bellicosity had something to do with the North Koreans deciding to come to the table, Mr. Schiff said on ABCs This Week.

Admittedly, the compliment was back-handed, and Mr. Schiff, a frequent White House critic, followed up by warning the president not to get too cocky.
