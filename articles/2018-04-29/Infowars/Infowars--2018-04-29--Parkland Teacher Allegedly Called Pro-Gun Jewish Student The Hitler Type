A Parkland, Fla., history teacher allegedly called a pro-Second Amendment Jewish student the Hitler type and dangerous, according to a Friday report.

Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School teacher Gregory Pittman allegedly made the remarks about junior Kyle Kashuv in class when a student mentioned a Twitter dispute between Pittman and Kashuv, reported Fox News.

I find it utterly vile that hed call a Jew the next Hitler, Kashuv told Fox. The students family moved from Israel to the U.S. in the 1990s. Its also quite telling that he doesnt know that Hitler took the peoples weaponry and I want more law-abiding citizens to have firearms.

Pittman allegedly made the comments during a class in which Kashuv was not enrolled. At least three students told the junior that the teacher said he was the next Hitler, according to the Sun Sentinel. The Twitter dispute precipitating the alleged remarks started when Kashuv posted a video and photo documenting his first gun shooting experience with his father, an Israel Defense Forces vet.
