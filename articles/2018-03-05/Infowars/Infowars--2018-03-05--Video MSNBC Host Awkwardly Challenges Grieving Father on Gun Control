As with all of the usual suspects on cable news, MSNBC ran more than a week-long full court press for gun control following the tragic Parkland, Florida school shooting.

Thus it should come as no surprise that stand-in host Chris Jansing struggled to remain neutral while interviewing Andrew Pollack, a grieving father who disagreed with the networks stance on gun restrictions.

Pollack appeared on MSNBC Live With Craig Melvin on Monday to discuss his support for a school safety bill. The legislation in question included a school marshal program, which would enable school staff volunteers to carry concealed firearms during school hours after receiving the appropriate training.
