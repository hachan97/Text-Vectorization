When youre sitting in front of Rep. Joe Kennedy, its clear that youre sitting in front of a Kennedy. The face, the jawline  its all uncannily familiar.

But Kennedy, the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, is rising in a changed Democratic Party. In the 1950s, the nonwhite share of the Democratic vote was about 7 percent. In 2012, it was about 44 percent  and that number is ticking upward.

Kennedy is navigating it smoothly. Tapped to give the Democratic response to the State of the Union  and youll want to listen to him tell the story of how that came about  he delivered a powerful performance in a speaking slot that usually buries ambitious young politicians. And he did it by reminding Democrats that their rhetoric can be bigger than their divisions, that a party built on difference can still see its way to a national identity.

In this conversation, recorded for my podcast, Kennedy and I talk about the policies that lie behind that speech. Where should Democrats go on health care, on economics, on drugs? Is the divide over identity politics and economic populism really a false choice, as Kennedy argues? And how do Democrats talk about unity when Trump keeps driving the national conversation into divisive issues?
