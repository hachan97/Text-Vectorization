Dustin Johnson shot a three-under-par 67 to move into the clubhouse lead during the second round of the US Open.

The world number one, joint overnight leader, had four birdies and one bogey and is four under at Shinnecock Hills.

England's Tommy Fleetwood improved to one over after carding six birdies in a four-under 66, but Tiger Woods (72) is at 10 over and likely to miss the cut.

Ian Poulter, joint leader after round one, is among the late starters, along with Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose.

Englishman Poulter had a one-under 69 on Thursday, while Rose posted a 71. McIlroy had a disastrous 80 though and needs an under-par round to have any chance of making the halfway cut.

Johnson, who won last week at the St Jude Classic to return to world number one hit 12 of 14 fairways but just 12 of the 18 greens in regulation.

Having started on the back nine, the highlight for the 2016 champion was a 45-foot birdie putt at the par-three seventh.

His only bogey, and fourth of the week, came at the first after finding a greenside bunker and failing to get up and down.

The American, one of only three players to score under par among the early starters, is looking to become the first player to win the US Open immediately after a victory on the PGA Tour.

"The course is playing really long and it's definitely tough out there, but I felt like i played a really solid round. I hit some nice pitches from around the greens," said Johnson.

Fleetwood had a couple of birdies and a bogey in his opening four holes and closed with three birdies in five holes to post a 66 - the lowest round of the week so far.

The world number 12, who finished fourth at Erin Hills last year, missed just one fairway and two greens in a superb round.

"Today was survival at one point, but I just happened to get something going at the end. Overall. very, very good and I am happy to be off the course," he said.

Sweden's Henrik Stenson joined Fleetwood at one over after a second round of level-par 70.
