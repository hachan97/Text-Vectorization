Brigham and Womens Hospital, a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, is taking down its prominent display of its past medical legends because too many are white men.

Diversity and inclusion initiatives prompted the removal of 30 portraits from the hospitals Bornstein Amphitheater because the paintings reinforce that white men are in charge, one professor said. The Boston Globe first reported the news, writing that past white male luminaries will be dispersed to put the focus on diversity.

Portraits that had hung in the amphitheater for decades will now be moved to less visible areas like conference rooms and lobby halls.
