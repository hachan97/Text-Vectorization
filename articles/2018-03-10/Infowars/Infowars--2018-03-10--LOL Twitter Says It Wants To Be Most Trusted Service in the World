Twitter executives hosted a Periscope video livestream recently where they asked for advice on how to fix their platform and stated their wish to be the most trusted service in the world.

The Periscope livestream featured Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey alongside some other Twitter executives discussing the future of the platform. The livestream comes shortly after the company opened their site to suggestions from users on how to improve the platform with the aim of developing metrics to measure the health of conversation on Twitter.

Ultimately we want to have a measurement of how it affects the broader society and public health, but also individual health, as well, Dorsey said during the livestream.
