Three Russian oligarchs who've previously sued over the publication of the Trump-Russia dossier have opened a new lawsuit in DC's local court against British agent-turned-researcher Christopher Steele and his company Orbis Business Intelligence Limited.

The trio of Fridman, Aven and Khan have brought similar defamation cases against Fusion GPS, which commissioned the dossier, and BuzzFeed, which published it online in January 2017, in New York state court and the federal court in DC.
