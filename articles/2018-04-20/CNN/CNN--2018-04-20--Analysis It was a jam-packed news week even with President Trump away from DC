It's been a stormy start to spring so far for the Trump administration, with adult film star Stormy Daniels dominating headlines. But -- this being the Trump administration -- the Daniels news wasn't even the biggest news of the week.

Comey, who was fired by Trump last year, released his book "A Higher Loyalty" on Tuesday and has been making media rounds -- and headlines -- all week.
