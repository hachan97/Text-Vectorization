President Trump on Friday knocked OPEC in a morning tweet, accusing the alliance of oil-producing countries of artificially raising prices on oil at a time when the resource is plentiful.

Trump warned that the U.S. will not accept artificial price controls from OPEC, which represents 14 of the worlds leading oil producers.

Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted! Trump tweeted.

Saudi Arabias energy minister Khalid al-Falih responded directly to Trumps tweet in a statement to CNBC, telling the network that markets should determine price.
