President Trump took to Twitter Friday morning and released a tirade of anger directed at Former FBI head James Comey following the release of Comeys book and the leaking of classified memos.

Trump noted that Comey has been allowed to get away with leaking classified information to the media, making libelous claims, and even putting out full on lies, while Trumps former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn has had his life and career totally destroyed by the investigation headed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I dont think so! Trump exclaimed.

In the infancy of the Russian collusion investigation, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about communications with the Russians after the election, prompting Trump to fire him.

In his book Comey claims, the president asked him to drop the FBI investigation of Flynn, saying he was a good man being needlessly targeted.

In a further tweet, the President addressed Comeys memos concerning private conversations between the two, after they were leaked to the media on Thursday. Trump suggests that there is proof that the former FBI director leaked classified information.

The 15 pages of documents show that Trump told Comey that he had serious concerns about the judgment of Flynn, and asked about the possibility of jailing journalists.

The memos also detail an alleged offer from Vladimir Putin about Russia prostitutes being some of the most beautiful hookers in the world.

Comey claims that the purpose of creating the memos was because he knew there might come a day when I would need a record of what had happened to defend himself and the FBI.

Trump also slammed former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, noting that Comey just threw Andrew McCabe under the bus.
