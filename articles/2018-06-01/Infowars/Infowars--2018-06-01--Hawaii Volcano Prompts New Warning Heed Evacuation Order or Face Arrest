As molten lava continued spewing from Hawaiis Kilauea volcano Thursday, Hawaii County ordered all residents of a designated portion of the hard-hit Leilani Estates development to evacuate by Friday morning or face possible arrest.

Big Island Mayor Harry Kim declared a roughly 17-block swath of the estates off limits indefinitely and gave residents 24 hours to get out by 12:06 p.m. local time Friday, Reuters reported.

Those remaining in the mandatory evacuation area beyond the deadline do so at their own risk, with the knowledge that emergency responders may not respond, the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency said in a statement.
