MSNBC host Joy Reid said Saturday that she doesnt believe she wrote the series of homophobic blog posts that were recently discovered under her name, but apologized for the controversy that erupted this week.

Heres what I know: I genuinely do not believe I wrote those hateful things, she said on her show AM Joy.

But I can definitely understand based on things I have tweeted and have written in the past why some people dont believe me, she continued.

Ive not been exempt from being dumb or cruel or hurtful to the very people I want to advocate for  I own that, I get it  and for that Im truly sorry.
