MOBILE COUNTY, AL (WALA)  A local teachers Facebook post is causing quite the controversy. She claims she was sent home from school to change her shirt because it had the word pray on it.

When teacher Chris Burrell picked her shirt to wear to school on Monday morning, it reminded her of 11-year-old Aubreigh Nicholas. It has just prayon it, in support of Aubreighs Army, a fundraiser to help the young dancer from Semmes diagnosed with a rare and inoperable brain tumor last year.

But thats not the way the schools principal saw it.
