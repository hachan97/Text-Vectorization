As Tom Brokaw faces allegations of making unwanted sexual advances in the 1990s, more than 70 female journalists have signed a letter supporting the embattled former NBC anchor.

Key names on the letter include NBC and MSNBC anchors and correspondents Andrea Mitchell, Kelly ODonnell, Rachel Maddow and even Mika Brzezinski, who added her name to the list later via Twitter.

The letter, obtained by The Hollywood Reporter, includes former and current females colleagues who have worked with Brokaw, from producers, correspondents, anchors, directors, executives, researchers, personal assistants, editors and technical staff, and seeks to share perspectives on working with the former longtime NBC anchor.
