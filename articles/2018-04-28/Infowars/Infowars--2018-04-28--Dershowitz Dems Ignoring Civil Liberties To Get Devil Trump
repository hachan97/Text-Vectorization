Democrats are ready to eliminate civil liberties if it means convicting President Donald Trump of a crime, Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz said Saturday.

The way they go after our rights is to first go after political enemies, establish precedence on the basis of the political enemies, Dershowitz told Fox News Fox and Friends. Then that precedent lies around like a loaded gun and is used against anybody.

Dershowitz referred to the 1966 movie A Man for All Seasons, when the protagonist, Sir Thomas More, said he would give the devil the right of the law, but his opponent replied if you knock down all the laws to get the devil, the next thing that will happen is the devil will use that to come after you.'
