Former newspaper magnate Conrad Black says that Donald Trump has launched a bloodless civil war against the establishment and that he is winning.

In an interview with current affairs program The Agenda, Black remarked, What was needed was a bloodless civil war to clean up the Washington sleaze factory.

The entire government of the United States had become a shambles. Let me remind you, in the previous 20 years, you had the greatest economic crisis since the 1930s brought on by bad American policy from both parties in both branches of government, said Black.

You had virtually the entire conventional land forces capability of the United States military mired in the Middle East for 15 years, he added, going on to point out that this led to the international migrant crisis and that it was all caused by utter incompetence in American policymaking.

The former National Post owner went on to point out how the continued collapse of GDP growth created an environment of near civil unrest.

The country was a pressure cooker. Poverty went up, violence rose, discontent rose, but our great national media in the United States didnt notice it and Trump said it is all rotten, weve got to clean it all up  Hollywood, the national media, the lobbyists, campaign financing, all factions of both parties.

Black concluded by asserting, Theyre all useless and weve got to get rid of them. And hes doing it and its a war.

Black would be in a position to know if Trump was succeeding against the establishment given that he used to move in those very circles, being a former Steering Committee member of the Bilderberg Group.
