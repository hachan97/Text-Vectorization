Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells wife confronted protesters looking to harass them about President Trumps immigration policies.

Elaine Chao marched up to the anti-Trump protestors outside Georgetown University on Monday in defense of her husband, telling them Why dont you leave my husband alone?

Hes not. You leave him alone! Chao replied.

Confrontations between leftists and Trump officials have spiked in recent weeks after the mainstream media drummed up outrage by misrepresenting the nature of the presidents zero-tolerance immigration policy.

In just the last week, a Virginia restaurant ejected White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, a leftist ambushed White House advisor Stephen Miller yelling fascist at a Mexican restaurant, and others prevented Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi from entering a movie theater.

Rhetoric from the left has only increased during that period, as California Democrat Maxine Waters called for even more harassment and intimidation of Trump officials on Saturday.

Lets make sure we show up wherever we have to show up. And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. And you push back on them. And you tell them theyre not welcome anymore, anywhere. Weve got to get the children connected to their parents, she told a crowd.
