President Trump has not invited the media or any Democratic members of Congress to his first state dinner with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday.

It is a break with tradition, said Lea Berman, who was White House social secretary under former President George W. Bush.

In the past, state dinners have hosted hundreds of guests, but this state dinner hosted by First Lady Melania Trump will have approximately 150.

In total, only about 150 people are expected to attend next weeks dinner, Politico reported. [Speaker] Ryan; the two Republican senators from Louisiana, Bill Cassidy and John Kennedy; and House Foreign Affairs Chair Ed Royce will be the only members of Congress attending, according to a person familiar with the guest list. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was invited, but will not be able to attend, his office said.
