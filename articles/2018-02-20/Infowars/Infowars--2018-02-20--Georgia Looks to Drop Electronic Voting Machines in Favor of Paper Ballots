A unique effort is underway in Georgia to safeguard elections by taking voting machines back to the future.

The most secure elections in the world are conducted with a piece of paper and a pencil, said Georgia State Rep. Scot Turner. It allows you to continue into the future to verify the result.

Turner has proposed a bill that would retire Georgias electronic touch-screen voting machines and switch to paper ballots that voters would fill out and then be counted by optical scan machines. The technology has been in use for decades to score standardized tests for grade-school students.
