Thirteen months into President Trumps administration, there is still no evidence whatsoever that Trump or any of his associates colluded with Russian operatives meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign.

That total lack of evidence has some establishment journalists finally wondering if there wasnt any Trump-Russia collusion after all, despite Democratic conspiracy theories to the contrary.

Politico Magazine editor-in-chief Blake Hounshell over the weekend penned a piece confessing his skepticism of the collusion conspiracy theory. Hounshells primary argument was that the Trump campaign was too inept to have successfully colluded with Russia without the public finding out.

Political journalists on Twitter passed around Hounshells thesis  that maybe the president didnt collude with Russian hackers and online trolls  as a novel idea.

But the truth is reasons for skepticism have existed in plain sight for months.
