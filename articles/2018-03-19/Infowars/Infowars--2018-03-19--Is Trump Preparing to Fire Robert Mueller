Donald Trump went on a Twitter rant this weekend, firing off several fact-free observations about the Mueller probe into election meddling by Russia and raising speculation in Washington that he would fire the special counsel in the next few days.

Adding fuel to the fire, Trumps lawyer, John Dowd, called for an end to the investigation. Dowd told CNN in a statement, I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia collusion investigation manufactured by McCabes boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt dossier.

Republicans are extremely nervous about the prospect of a Mueller firing.

I dont see the President firing him, Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma said on ABCs This Week. I think the White House has said 10 times, maybe more, that theyre not going to fire Robert Mueller. They want him to be able to finish the investigation. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said he would not advocate for Trump to fire Mueller, while Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina offered the sharpest rebuke.
