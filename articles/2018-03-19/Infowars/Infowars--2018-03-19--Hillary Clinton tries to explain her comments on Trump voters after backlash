Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton attempted to explain her comments about American voters and the 2016 election in a lengthy Facebook post Saturday that claimed she meant no disrespect to any individual or group.

During a recent trip to India, Clinton told attendees at a conference in Mumbai that Americans did not deserve a Trump presidency, said she won the states that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forward, and said that Trumps campaign was looking backwards.

Clinton summed up Trumps message as you know, you didnt like black people getting rights, you dont like women, you know, getting jobs. You dont want, you know, to see that Indian American succeeding more than you are.

I understand how some of what I said upset people and can be misinterpreted, Clinton said in her Facebook post. I meant no disrespect to any individual or group. And I want to look to the future as much as anybody.

But the former first lady criticized Trump for relying on scare tactics and false attacks [that masked] the fact that he is otherwise no friend to most Americans.
