Is the foundation of our revolt against the elites  which the liberals and the Fredocons call Trumpism because they dont want to face the fact that Normals are tired of their corruption and incompetence  merely trolling by a bunch of malcontents?

True, we do enjoy messing with them. You look at the avatar of the movement, Donald Trump, and hes the Trollmaster Level XII Emeritus. This guy lays down the smack, and a lot of Americans are delighted by his antics.

But is that all this is? Is our movement simply about slamming the people were annoyed at and nothing more?

Of course not.
