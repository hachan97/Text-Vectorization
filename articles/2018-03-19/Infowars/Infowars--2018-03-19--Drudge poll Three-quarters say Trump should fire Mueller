More than three-quarters of people who answered a poll on the conservative Drudge Report site said that President Trump should fire special counsel Robert Mueller.

Mueller is currently investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Moscow.

The online poll, which was posted on the site on Saturday, had surveyed fewer than 500,000 people on Sunday.

The poll comes after Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe over the findings of an internal review that said he provided unauthorized information to the press and was not forthcoming with investigators during the investigation. McCabe said he was fired as an attempt to undermine Muellers investigation.

Trumps personal lawyer said on Saturday that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should end Muellers investigation. He later walked back his statement, saying he was speaking for himself, not on behalf of the president.
