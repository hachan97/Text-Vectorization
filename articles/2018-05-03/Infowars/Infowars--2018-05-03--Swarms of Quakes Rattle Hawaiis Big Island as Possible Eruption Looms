Swarms of earthquakes  as many as eight to 10 temblors per hour  continue to rattle Puna, and residents along Kilaueas east rift zone are being told to prepare for a possible eruption that could come with very little warning to evacuate.

A volcano watch has been issued as the potential for an eruption rises.

On Wednesday, there were several scares as quakes created cracks in roadways.

Authorities closed Pohoiki Road is closed between Highway 132 and Leilani Avenue due to a widening crack in the road.
