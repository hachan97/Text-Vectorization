President Trumps approval rating amongst black males has doubled since the start of the Kanye West controversy, proving that the publicity surrounding Kanyes comments is helping Trump secure new potential voters.

Before Kanyes support for Trump became one of the biggest news stories of the year so far, Trumps approval rating stood at just 11 per cent amongst African-American males.

According to Reuters, on April 29, a week in to the Kanye controversy, that figure shot up to 22 per cent.

In other words, double the number of African-American males now have a positive view of Trump thanks to Kanyes intervention.

The jump in the numbers corresponds directly with Kanye West expressing his support for the ideas of conservative commentator Candace Owens and Kanye openly expressing his love for Trump.

The figures not only prove Andrew Breitbarts old adage that politics is downstream from culture, they fly in the face of establishment conservatives who are claiming that Trump supporters should not embrace Kanye and his message.

Please do not attach yourselves to Kanye West  it will backfire. Mark my words, it will backfire, Fox News commentator Tomi Lahren asserted in a rant posted to her Facebook page last night.

If doubling the number of African-American males who support Trump in the space of a week is what backfiring looks like, then God only knows what success would look like in comparison.

Ben Shapiros initial response to Kanyes tweetstorm was to attack Trump supporters desperation for embracing Kanyes message.

If such desperation ensures that Republicans hold on to the House later this year while also securing Trumps re-election in 2020, then conservatives should hope to be feeling a lot more desperate over the next couple of years.
