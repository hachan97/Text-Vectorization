At least six officers have been injured after a sudden explosion rocked a house in Connecticut, where police and SWAT officers were negotiating with a man who had taken his wife and family hostage.

Up to six police officers were reportedly injured in an explosion in North Haven, Connecticut, where a man took his family hostage after police responded to a domestic dispute call. The officers were rushed to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries at around 8:30 pm.



It sounds almost like it was a booby trap type of explosion, Freda said. Based on the way the explosions took place, from what police told me, there was a series of explosions, which may indicate some sort of rigged booby traps.

The suspects wife apparently managed to escape the house during the explosions, but it remains unclear whether other family members remain inside. The suspect, however, is still inside the house, while a fire is still burning in the barn, sources told WFSB Channel 3 news.

The roads surrounding the residence remain closed off. Meanwhile, firefighters rushed to the scene to battle the blaze as plumes of thick black smoke covered the neighborhood after the blast.

The hostage situation erupted after a domestic violence incident on Wednesday afternoon that was reported to North Haven police, state police Master Sgt. Marc Gelven, confirmed to the Hartford Courant. According to reports, it was the woman herself who called the police after her husband arrived home and began an argument over a divorce that she filed for last month.

The man then barricaded himself inside the house, triggering a massive police and SWAT team response. Authorities were trying to negotiate with the hostage taker for hours before the blast went off. FBI and AFT agents were also called to the scene, according to reports.
