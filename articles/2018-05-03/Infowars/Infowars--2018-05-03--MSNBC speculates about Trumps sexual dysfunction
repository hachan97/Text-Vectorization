Bornstein told NBC News Trumps longtime personal bodyguard Keith Schiller and another large man conducted stormed into his Manhattan office just days after he revealed to The New York Times that he had prescribed Trump Propecia for years. Propecia is a drug for enlarged prostates thats also used to stimulate hair growth, NBC reports.

The 70-year-old doctor also claimed Trump himself authored a 2015 letter about his health attributed to Borstein that declared The Donald is in astonishingly excellent shape and would be the healthiest president in the history of the United States.
