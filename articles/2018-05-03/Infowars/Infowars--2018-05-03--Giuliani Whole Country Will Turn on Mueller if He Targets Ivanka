Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani sent a warning to special counsel Robert Mueller on Wednesday: stay away from Ivanka Trump.

Giuliani, one of the lawyers helping President Donald Trump navigate the Russia investigation, told Fox News Sean Hannity the whole country will turn on Mueller if he targets the presidents oldest daughter.

Giuliani was responding to a report in Politico that suggested Mueller could use Ivanka to get to her father. Hannity brought up that report and noted former White House communications director Hope Hicks, a longtime Trump aide, paid more in lawyers and she was ever paid as a result of the Mueller investigation.

I wish the American people could get to know [Hicks]; shes one of the nicest human beings youre ever going to meet. And she is very loyal to Donald Trump, but I think the president would say this: she would stand up to him when she had to, Giuliani said. What they did to her is absolutely outrageous.

Ivanka Trump? I think I would get on my charger and go ride into their offices with a lance, if they go after Ivanka, the former mayor continued. Now if they do do Ivanka, which I dont think they will, the whole country will turn on them. If they go after her, the whole country will turn on them. Theyre going after his daughter?
