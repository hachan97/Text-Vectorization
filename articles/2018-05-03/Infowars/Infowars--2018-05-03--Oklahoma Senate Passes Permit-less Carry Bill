Senate Bill 1212, also referred to as the Constitutional Carry bill, was presented by Sen. Nathan Dahm, R-Broken Arrow. It passed the Oklahoma Senate on Wednesday night by a vote of 33 to 9. If ultimately signed into law, it would allow for open carry without a permit.

On the Senate floor Wednesday night, Sen. Dahm said 12 states have already passed similar legislation; however, the measure was not met without criticism.

Sen. Kay Floyd, D-Oklahoma, who voted against the measure, said it wasnt properly vetted.
