The second round of the BBC's World Cup of kits is over.

We will have the results from the eight ties in our live World Cup page from approximately 13:30 BST, while you can also go there to join in the debate on classic kits.

Selections for the quarter-finals will open at 14:00.

The original 32 kits were selected by a panel of BBC Sport journalists with former England internationals Danny Mills and Stephen Warnock conducting a draw for the first round.
