President Trump blasted Democrats on Tuesday over what he suggested was their failure to strike a deal to protect young undocumented immigrants from deportation, saying that an agreement could still be reached.

Total inaction on DACA by Dems. Where are you? A deal can be made! Trump tweeted, using an acronym for the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

It was the second time since Monday that Trump leveled a Twitter attack on Democrats over DACA. A day earlier, he said Democrats were nowhere to be found when it came to DACA negotiations.
