A 20-year-old is suing Dicks Sporting Goods after being refused a Ruger .22 rifle purchase based on his age.

Watson attempted to buy the rifle on or about February 24 at a Medford, Oregon, Field and Stream store. (Field and Stream is subsidiary of Dicks.)  Watsons suit, filed in the Circuit Court of Oregon for the County of Jackson, says a store employee refused the purchase and indicated, He would not sell [Watson] any firearm, including rifles and shotguns, or ammunition for a firearm, because [Watson] is under 21 years old.

The employee referenced Dicks recent policy shift, disallowing firearm sales to anyone under 21, and cited the policy as the reason for denying the sale.

Watsons suit alleges that Dicks policy violates Oregon law against age-based discrimination for people 18 years and older in places of public accommodations. State law includes prohibitions against discrimination in stores that are open to the general public.
