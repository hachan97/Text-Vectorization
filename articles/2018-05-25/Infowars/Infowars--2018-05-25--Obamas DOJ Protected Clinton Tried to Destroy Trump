You dont need to believe that the special counsel investigating President Donald Trump is a terrible person to conclude that the Obama administration and Clinton machine (and later their holdovers during the Trump administration) politicized and weaponized federal agencies to protect Hillary Clinton and damage Trump.

So if you just cant shake your instinct that Robert Mueller is the epitome of virtue and professionalism, hold fast to it, but consider the litany of facts that prove serious and abundant malfeasance on the part of the Obama-Clinton deep state actors.

The Department of Justice, especially the FBI, bent over backward to protect Clinton and bent over forward to harm Trump. Despite those efforts, the stubborn facts have emerged, thanks to patriots relentlessly pursuing the truth. More will be revealed as the Obama-Clinton glass house continues to shatter, but theres already enough to make an objective person gasp. If Clinton had won the election, this evidence would have remained buried, and the power-abusing left would have been emboldened to continue to thwart the rule of law and target its opponents. Before you say its preposterous that Obama or Clinton would have politicized and weaponized government agencies, remember the actions of Obamas IRS and EPA.

As for protecting Clinton, consider this partial list:

 Then-FBI Director James Comey wrote a letter exonerating her in advance of interviewing her and other key witnesses.

 Comey presented a strong case against her yet shielded her from prosecution.

 Comey claimed that Christopher Steeles dossier was not an indispensable part of the FISA warrant application, when everyone has admitted it was. He said he didnt know that the Clintons had paid for the dossier.
