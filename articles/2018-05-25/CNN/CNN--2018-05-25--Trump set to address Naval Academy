President Donald Trump is set to deliver the commencement address at the US Naval Academy here on Friday, addressing more than 1,000 graduates who will become commissioned officers in the US Navy and Marine Corps.

The President's speech comes a day after he kicked up fears of ratcheting tensions on the Korean peninsula after he canceled a diplomatic summit with North Korea's leader scheduled for next month.

But the President, addressing reporters on the South Lawn of the White House before departing for the Naval Academy, made clear the door to diplomacy remains open -- cooling fears that the scuttled summit could mean a return to the saber-rattling that has defined the US-North Korean relationship for much of Trump's presidency.

"We're talking to them now," Trump said. "We'll see what happens. It could even be the 12th (of June). We're talking to them now."

The White House declined to preview the President's speech on Friday, but Trump last year did not shy away from political controversy during his speech at the Coast Guard Academy's graduation ceremony.

Warning graduates that "things are not always fair" he urged them to "fight, fight, fight" before complaining about the way he was being treated, "especially by the media. "No politician in history -- and I say this with great surety -- has been treated worse or more unfairly," he told Coast Guard graduates a year ago.
