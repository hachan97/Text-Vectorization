On Saturday, thousands of people from around the US hit the streets of Washington, DC, to participate in the March for Our Lives  the main event protesting gun violence in schools, which came as a response to last months shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which killed 17. Since then, survivors of the shooting have rallied people across the country, particularly other students, to speak out and try to make sure what happened in Florida never happens again.

The protesters also happen to be incredible at making signs. Lots and lots of signs. A few themes recur: The signs generally blast politicians for their inaction on gun violence, and they criticize the role that the National Rifle Association (also known as the NRA) plays in our current political debate. Some of the signs are tragic and sad, while others are more clever or funny.
