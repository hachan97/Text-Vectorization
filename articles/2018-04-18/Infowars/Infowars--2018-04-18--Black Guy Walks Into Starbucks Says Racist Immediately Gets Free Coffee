A new video shows a black man walking into Starbucks, dropping the word racist and immediately being given a free coffee.

The stunt was in response to news that Starbucks is set to close 8,000 stores for an afternoon for race-bias training.

Bryan Sharpe, who goes by Hotep Jesus on Twitter, recorded himself walking into a Starbucks and telling a barista, I heard yall was racist, so I came to get my free coffee.

I heard yall dont like black people, so I came to get my Starbucks reparations voucher, adds Sharpe and the girl, who is white, immediately complies.

Is that a real thing? she says. I mean, Ill give it to you, I saw that on my Twitter last night and I was like, what the f**k!

Sharpe gets his free coffee and leaves the store.

Black privilege gets me free coffee. I love racism. Only in America, he subsequently tweeted.

Other users dubbed the video the #StarbucksChallenge, suggesting that more people may try to copy Sharpes stunt in the coming days.

Starbucks will close 8,000 stores on May 29 so 175,000 employees can undergo racial tolerance training.

The decision was made in response to an incident in Philadelphia when two black men entered a Starbucks and asked to use a bathroom. When an employee told them it was only for paying customers, the men sat in the store without ordering. The manager then called the police and the men were arrested.

Back in 2015, Starbucks announced it was launch a nationwide program where baristas would write the words race together on Starbucks cups to start a conversation about race.

The initiative was a complete failure and became the laughing stock of the Internet.
