After news broke that Barbara Bush had passed away Tuesday, many Americans were mourning and remembering her life, while others were gleeful about trolling.

Fresno State professor Randa Jarrar provoked the most controversy of all after she went into a sickening rant against Bush, saying, Barbara Bush was a generous and smart and amazing racist who, along with her husband, raised a war criminal.

She also reportedly said, Im happy the witch is dead.

She has since locked her account, and Fresno State responded.
