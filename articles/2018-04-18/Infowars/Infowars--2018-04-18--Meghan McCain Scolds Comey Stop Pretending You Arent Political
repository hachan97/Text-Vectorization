The View host Meghan McCain took former FBI Director James Comey to the woodshed on Wednesday, telling him to stop pretending to be apolitical because he sounds like a political commentator.

I think maybe J. Edgar Hoover is rolling over in his grave at the things youre revealing, McCain told Comey.

The big issue is, I dont want to know your politics. And a lot of the things youre saying and doing are highly political. And I just dont understand what you gain trying to sort of clear the deck here by bringing things like this up.

Comey responded that he doesnt see his anti-Trump and pro-Obama views in his book A Higher Loyalty as his politics so much as values that he holds.
