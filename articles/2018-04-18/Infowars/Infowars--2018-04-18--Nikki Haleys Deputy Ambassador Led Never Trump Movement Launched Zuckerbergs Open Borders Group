United Nations (U.N.) Deputy Ambassador Jon Lerner has deep ties to not only his longtime colleague and boss, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, but also Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the failed Never Trump movement, and the pro-mass immigration billionaire GOP mega-donors the Koch brothers.

Lerner, 49, withdrew from consideration to become Vice President Mike Pences national security adviser after news broke that President Trump was reportedly livid that a key member of the Never Trump movement would be joining his White House.

Still, Lerner has squeezed his way into the administration he avidly fought against despite having no foreign policy experience, with a source telling the New York Times that the consultant will informally advise the White House on national security.

Nikki Haley first hired Lerner for her successful gubernatorial campaign in South Carolina. Then, after winning the South Carolina governorship, Haley kept Lerner around as one of her senior strategists.

Haley endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) in the 2016 GOP presidential primary and infamously indirectly attacked Trumps America First agenda in her 2016 State of the Union response while Lerner was advising her.
