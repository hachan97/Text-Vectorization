Judging by David Hoggs past success, now is probably a good time to buy Vanguard and BlackRock funds.

One of Parkland, Fla.s most prominent student activists on stopping gun violence has called for a boycott of Vanguard and BlackRock, two of the worlds biggest investors in gunmakers. In a post on Twitter on Tuesday, David Hogg remarked on the firms ownership of gun maker stocks, adding if you use them, feel free to let them know. Then he added two tags: BoycottVanguard BoycottBlackrock.

Hoggs call for a boycott already appears to be falling flat as he only managed to garner a few thousand retweets:

BlackRocks Democrat CEO Laurence Fink has already said theyve made funds for people who dont want gun stocks (few were interested).

As theyre both mega-corporations, both companies are pretty much already on board with an anti-gun agenda, so theyre an odd target for a boycott.

BlackRock is the top shareholder in gunmakers Sturm Ruger (RGR) and American Outdoor Brands (AOBC). Its the second-largest shareholder in Vista Outdoor (VSTO). Vanguard is the second-largest shareholder in Sturm Ruger, and the third-largest shareholder in American Outdoor Brands and Vista Outdoor. A Vanguard spokesperson said that most Vanguard funds do not have exposure to gun manufacturers, and that 359 of its 388 funds do not directly invest in Sturm Ruger, American Outdoor Brands or Vista Outdoor. Investors can also put their money in a Vanguard social fund that excludes gunmakers. Importantly, Vanguard is taking action, meeting with the leaders of gun manufacturers and distributors, the company said in a statement. We want to know how they will mitigate the risks that their products pose and how they plan to help prevent such tragedies from happening again.

As I reported on Tuesday, Hoggs boycott of Laura Ingraham backfired epically with Ingraham getting record ratings on the week she returned and at least one advertiser who joined the boycott reversing their decision.
