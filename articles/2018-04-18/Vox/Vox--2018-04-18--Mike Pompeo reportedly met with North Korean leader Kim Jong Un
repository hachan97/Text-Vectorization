Mike Pompeo, CIA director and nominee for secretary of state, met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea over Easter weekend  a major sign that Washington and Pyongyang are setting the stage for historic talks between President Donald Trump and Kim later this year.

The Washington Posts Shane Harris, Carol D. Leonnig, Greg Jaffe, and David Nakamura broke the news about the top-secret meeting late Tuesday night. Trump had hinted at Pompeos milestone visit earlier on Tuesday, saying at Mar-a-Lago  where hes hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe  that the US was engaging with North Korea at directly at extremely high levels. Trump added: I really believe theres a lot of goodwill. A lot of good things are happening.

Trumps statement was big news, though it was tough to pin down what exactly the president was referring to in his remarks. As Voxs Alex Ward wrote, direct talks at an extremely high level, as Trump says are now happening, are rare. Thats why its hard to know if the US and North Korea are actually speaking at a higher level than normal, or through an already established channel.

But it turns out it was different. A visit by Pompeo  one of Trumps most trusted advisers  is a sign that theres legitimate progress toward a historic meeting between Kim and Trump. According to the Post, Pompeo is the highest level official to meet with a North Korean leader since Madeline Albright met with Kim Jong Il, the current leaders father, as secretary state in 2000.

Trump is expected to sit down with Kim in late May or June, and a lot of details still have to get worked out before that happens. Having the current CIA director and nominee to be next secretary of state meet with directly with the North Korean leader himself is a pretty good way to start working those details out.
