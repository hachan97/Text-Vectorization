Alec Baldwin has announced hes going to take part in a 24-hour hunger strike, also known as a diet or intermittent fast, as some sort of protest against President Trump.

From People, Ethel Kennedy, 90, Joins Alec Baldwin and More Stars in Hunger Strike Against Trump Immigration Policy:

They wait until the sixth paragraph to inform readers that their hunger strike consists of a 24-hour intermittent fast.

The fast, which started Saturday, will last for 24 days, in honor of the estimated 2,400 children who have been separated from their parents due to Trumps policy. Each participant is asked to fast for 24 hours and make a donation in place of the meals they would have eaten.

Intermittent fasting is all the rage lately, so Im not sure how theyre passing off this vanity-driven weight loss regimen as a protest or a hunger strike.

Most of them, including Baldwin, could clearly use an intermittent fast (or two... or three) considering their unhealthy BMIs.

If libs are going to claim intermittent fasting as a protest against President Trump can we claim going low carb as a protest against open borders?
