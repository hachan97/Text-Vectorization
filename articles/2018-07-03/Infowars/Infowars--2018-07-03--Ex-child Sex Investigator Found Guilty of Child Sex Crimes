Former Florida Department of Law Enforcement supervisor Charles McMullen is guilty of nine child sex offenses surrounding his time as a foster parent and child sex crime investigator.

A Santa Rosa County jury heard six days worth of testimony and evidence beginning with jury selection Monday and returned with a guilty verdict late Saturday.

McMullen himself testified Friday night and into Saturday, according to prosecutor Anne Patterson, as the defense wrapped up its case.
