Tucker Carlson told the Heritage Foundation the best way for conservatives to take back America is to have more children and raise them the way that you want, consistent with your beliefs.

I grew up in a world where it was considered embarrassing to have more than two children, Carlson told Daily Signal editor-in-chief Rob Bluey at The Heritage Foundations 41st annual Resource Bank meeting in Fort Lauderdale, Florida last week.

I dont think thats the case now among middle-class, upper middle-class people, but it was, he said.

First of all, its the most rewarding, greatest, most fun thing you can do. But its also the most profound thing. If you dont like the direction of the country, have children, raise them the way that you want, consistent with your beliefs, Carlson said. It seems like all the answers are basic, nature-based answers, in my opinion. To everything. Thats the most basic of all, have more kids. Raise decent children.

Carlson continued: And the second was just say what you think is true. I dont actually think you get a ton out of confronting people and getting in peoples faces. I dont think youre going to convince anybody that way. But I think theres inherent value in speaking principle out loud without shame or fear. And again, without the expectation that youre going to win people over right away, because most times youre not going to.

Aggression really doesnt help much. Ive definitely concluded that after years of being aggressive. But I think telling the truth is an inherently valuable act.

General Social Survey data has shown white liberals in America have extremely low birth rates and only those who consider themselves extremely conservative are above replacement level.
