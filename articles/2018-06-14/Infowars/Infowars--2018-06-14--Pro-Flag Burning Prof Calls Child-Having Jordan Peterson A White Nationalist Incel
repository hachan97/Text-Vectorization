A professor who has called Dr. Jordan B. Peterson an incel wrote a post Sunday saying that she will not be silenced.

Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania philosophy professor Wendy Lynne Lee seemed not to be aware of the existence of Petersons wife and kids when she called him a misogynist incel on Twitter. An incel, or involuntary celibate, is shorthand for a man who has trouble attracting sexual partners and often checks out of the dating scene.

News outlets popularized the term incel after the April Toronto massacre by Alek Minassian, who identified with the group.
