A live TV poll taken on Michelle Wolfs Netflix show found that 71% of the comedians liberal audience would rather peace with North Korea fail than see Donald Trump take credit for it.

The audience was asked, Are you sort of hoping we dont get peace with North Korea so you wouldnt have to give Trump credit?

Only 29% said they wanted peace with North Korea given the option.

Wolfs guest on the show subsequently remarked, Thats how liberal they are that they would rather the world explode, theyre like I told you guys he was an asshole.

In other words, a significant majority of leftists would happily risk nuclear war, so long as it meant Trump would look bad.

Let that sink in.

When conservatives talk about how many on the left hate America, its seen by most as a tired cliche, but when you see clips like this it really makes you wonder.

Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale summed up the mood of many when he tweeted, Here is the medias and lefts position in a nutshell. It isnt about America.

Indeed, it seems that the left is so beset by Trump Derangement Syndrome that theyre quite happy to see the pilot crash the plane even though theyre on it.
