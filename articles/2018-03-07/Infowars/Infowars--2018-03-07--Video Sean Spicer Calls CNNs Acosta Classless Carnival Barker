Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer took aim at CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta in a Tuesday evening appearance on Fox News.

With respect to Mr. Acosta, what this comes down to in the recent tweet that he sent with respect to Sarah Sanders, he said that she, by not calling him, didnt show courage. Lets be honest. Jim Acosta is a carnival barker that is clueless and classless, Spicer declared, adding Dont talk about not getting a question being a lack of courage.
