Senator Ted Cruz (TX-R) had a heated argument with CNNs Chris Cuomo on Wednesday over the Texas primary and gun control.

Cruz told Cuomo the blue wave Democrats have been hoping to see in Tuesdays Texas primary did not come to pass, evidenced by the high turnout on the Republican side and him winning nearly 85% of that vote.

Theres a clear contrast on substance and policy and ideas, Cruz said, speaking of the stark policy differences between him and his far-left Democrat opponent Beto ORourke (D-TX).

Congressman ORourke is running hard to the left. He is embracing positions like open borders, like amnesty, hes embracing actions like aggressive advocacy of gun control and undermining our Second Amendment.

But this Texas, and those arent the views of the vast majority of Texans, and I think thats why you saw the overwhelming election results last night, he added.

Cruz also called out Democrats for shutting down the Grassley-Cruz bill, which he says could have prevented certain shootings without infringing on Second Amendment rights.

The shooter in Sutherland Springs, he had a felony conviction and domestic violence conviction. Why was he able to buy a firearm? Cruz asked. Grassley-Cruz would have fixed that. And heres the more important piece, Grassley-Cruz would have also directed the Department of Justice to prosecute felons and fugitives who try to illegally try to buy guns. The Department of Justice hasnt been doing that.
