Surprise firings, criminal investigations and vague statements that have world leaders scratching their heads has turned President Donald Trumps administration into political theater.

And the media  one of Trumps favorite go-to targets- is reaping the benefits. Experts expected media ratings to normalize after the election when the NFL and other popular TV shows started to air. Thats clearly not the case.

New York Times subscription revenue grew to more than $1 billion in 2017. It wasnt even affected by Donald Trumps constant criticism, including cancelling a meeting with the publication because he called their tactics of changing interview rules not nice.

But its not just the New York Times seeing the benefit. Another frequent subject of Trumps ire  the Washington Post  hit more than 1 million digital subscriptions for the first time in September 2017.
