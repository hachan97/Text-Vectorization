MSNBC host Joe Scarborough told viewers Monday that the Presidents physician sounds like Hitlers doctor, in an effort to derail the former Navy physicians nomination by Trump for secretary of veterans affairs.

Dr Ronny Jackson, an Iraq War veteran, has been nominated by Trump to succeed David Shulkin, but is facing allegations, according to anonymous sources cited by CBS, of creating a hostile work environment, as well as excessive drinking on the job and improperly dispensing meds.

This provided enough ammunition for Joe Scarborough and his motley crew to attempt a character assassination, based mainly on Jackson, who was also Barack Obamas doctor, issuing Trump a clean bill of health earlier in the year.

You dont have to be one of those people that work at circuses that look, Hey, I can guess your weight, to know that Donald Trump weighs a hell of a lot more than 239 pounds. That was embarrassing, Scarborough said, suggesting that Jackson lied about the presidents weight.

The topper of it all, the piece de resistance was when he said, and it sounded like Hitlers doctor, Im sorry. You know what, his genes are so good,' Scarborough continued.

If Hitlers doctor had a Brooklyn accent, Scarborough mockingly continued, adding His genes are so good. He could live to be 200 years old.'

Scarboroughs wife and co-host Mika Brzezinski threw in her two cents, suggesting that a sucking sound could be heard as Jackson spoke to the press about Trumps health in January.

That display about the presidents health I thought was quite incredible, she said.

Back in January Morning Joe, as well as CNNs Don Lemon refused to accept Jacksons medical analysis of the president, accusing the physician, who has been a White House doctor since 2006, of being a Trump fanboy.
