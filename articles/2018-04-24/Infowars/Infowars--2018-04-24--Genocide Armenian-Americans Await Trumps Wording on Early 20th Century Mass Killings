Armenians marking the 103rd anniversary Tuesday of the mass killing of their forebears in Ottoman Turkey are hoping President Trump will go further than last year, and use the word genocide to describe the atrocities.

On April 24 last year, Trumps statement used the Armenian phrase Meds Yeghern, which is variously translated great evil, great crime or great calamity.

President Obama also used the term in his later annual Apr. 24 statements  although he pledged while running for the White House to call the episode genocide  while his predecessors used words like tragedy or massacres.

Armenians and Armenian-Americans look back to President Reagan, who in a 1981 Holocaust Remembrance Day referred to the genocide of the Armenians.

The issue goes well beyond semantics, since the Turkish government has made it a foreign policy priority to deny that what happened a century ago constituted genocide. Genocide is as the intent to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, accompanied by atrocities aimed at achieving that goal.
