A special election Tuesday in New York will decide the fates of 11 open seats in the state legislature  and had the potential to give Democrats full control over the state legislature.

But the balance of power in Albany has already been determined, long before the polls close at 9 pm Eastern time.

Thats because state Sen. Simcha Felder, a Democrat who votes with the Republicans, has decided he will stick with the GOP, no matter Tuesdays results. This leaves Democrats in an impossible situation  even if they win the two open state Senate seats, they will still be one vote short of a majority because of Felders defection. (Nine vacancies in the Assembly will have less of an impact  the chamber is already overwhelmingly Democratic, and will remain so.)

Felder hasnt totally spoiled the election results. Democratic victories in two open Senate races  including one in a critical swing district, the 37th  could be a good omen as the party looks to take back the state Senate for good in November. The other vacancy is in the 32nd District, which covers a big section of the Bronx and heavily leans Democratic.

Well be updating this post with live results for the two state Senate races below throughout the night.
