With 100% of the precincts reporting, Cloud captured nearly 55% of the vote in a crowded field, avoiding a runoff.

He will serve out the remainder of Farenthold's term, which runs through January and is also running for a full two-year term.

Cloud ran as a Christian conservative, and adopted Trump's calls to "drain the swamp" and build a wall along the southern border. He had the endorsement of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and former congressman Ron Paul, according to The Washington Post.

Farenthold announced in December that he would not seek reelection after news broke he used taxpayer money to pay a settlement of $84,000 to a former aide who accused him of sexual harassment and other improper conduct.

Farenthold denied some of the allegations against him but also apologized for using inappropriate language and for his role in creating a hostile workplace. He resigned from office in April.
