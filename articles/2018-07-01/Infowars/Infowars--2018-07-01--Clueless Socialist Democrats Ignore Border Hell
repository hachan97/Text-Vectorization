One thing is for certain  Austin Texas is a liberal city.

The liberals came out in a giant blue wave, crashing on the steps of the Texas Capital to express their skewed understanding of the Trump Administrations zero tolerance stance on our southern border.

Where is the admittance of responsibility from the countries south of our border? Apparently everything is the fault of the U.S., even the massive third world issues of another country we have little control of.
