Former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik said it was outrageous if reports were confirmed that four Broward County sheriffs deputies failed to enter the Parkland, Florida, high school during a February 14 shooting that claimed 17 lives.

Its outrageous. Ive never heard anything like this before, Kerik told Newsmax on Saturday.

If these reports are true, these deputies are constitutionally bound to engage the shooter to protect the students, Kerik added.

He said the deputies should be investigated by the Florida attorney generals office, not by an interagency probe of the Broward County Sheriffs Department. If they neglected their duty, he maintained they should be charged with criminally negligent homicide.
