Earlier this month, Republicans released the Nunes memo, which alleged improprieties in the Department of Justice and the FBIs surveillance of former Trump adviser Carter Page. But Democrats on the committee led by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) accused the memo of being misleading, and put together their own memo in response.

Now, after a back and forth with the Trump administration, Democrats finally got permission to release their own memo in response, with some redactions. You can read the memo below, or at this link.
