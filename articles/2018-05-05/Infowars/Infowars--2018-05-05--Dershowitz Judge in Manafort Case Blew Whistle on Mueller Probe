Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard Law School professor emeritus, said the federal judge in the Paul Manafort case has validated his arguments against special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into President Trumps campaign.

U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III pressed Justice Department lawyers on Friday to explain how they did not exceed the scope of Muellers investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, and debated whether their ultimate goal was to get Manafort to turn on Trump.

You dont really care about Mr. Manaforts bank fraud ... You really care about getting information Mr. Manafort can give you that would reflect on Mr. Trump and lead to his prosecution or impeachment, Ellis told the Justice Department lawyers during Manaforts court appearance in Virginia.
