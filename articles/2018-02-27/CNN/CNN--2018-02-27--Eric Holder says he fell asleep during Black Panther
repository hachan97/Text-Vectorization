When Holder was asked by The Washington Post's Jonathan Capehart on the #CapeUp podcast if he identifies more as Wakanda monarch T'Challa or the supervillian Erik Killmonger, Holder said that he can't choose because he fell asleep while watching the film.

"I just saw it two nights ago and it seemed like a great movie, but I have to tell you, I had just come back from a long trip. I kind of fell asleep in the movie," Holder said. "So I'm going back, I'm going back. The parts that I saw I really liked."
