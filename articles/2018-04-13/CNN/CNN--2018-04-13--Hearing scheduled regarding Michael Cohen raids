A hearing is scheduled Friday morning in federal court in Manhattan related to the FBI search of the office, home and hotel room of President Donald Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen.

The hearing will address a temporary restraining order filed by Cohen regarding the search warrant, which was executed earlier this week, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.

Monday's raids included seeking records and communications related to efforts to suppress negative information ahead of the election, including communications that Trump had with Cohen regarding the infamous "Access Hollywood" tape that captured Trump making lewd remarks about women that surfaced a month before the election, CNN reported this week

The warrant also referenced an investigation into wire fraud, bank fraud and campaign finance. FBI agents removed Cohen's computer, cell phone, business files and financial documents.

On Monday, Cohen's attorney called the searches "completely inappropriate and unnecessary." "It resulted in the unnecessary seizure of protected attorney client communications between a lawyer and his client," attorney Stephen Ryan said in the statement.
