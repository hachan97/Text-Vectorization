President Trump on Monday forecasted a big week for infrastructure as the White House prepares to roll out its long-awaited proposal to rebuild American public works.

This will be a big week for Infrastructure, Trump wrote on Twitter.

After so stupidly spending $7 trillion in the Middle East, it is now time to start investing in OUR Country!

The White House on Monday will release principles for a $1.5 trillion infrastructure overhaul, a plan that will focus on public-private partnerships and funding from state and local governments.
