President Trumps newly proposed budget includes a proposal to end federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), part of a package that includes $300 billion in new spending overall.

CPB provides federal funding for PBS and National Public Radio stations.

The Budget proposes to eliminate Federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) over a two year period, according to the proposal.

CPB grants represent a small share of the total funding for the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR), which primarily rely on private donations to fund their operations, it continues.
