Prominent Democrats have repeatedly abandoned political norms and customs in order to oppose President Donald Trump.

Trumps presidency, and his candidacy before it, has been in large part defined by his willingness to abandon conventional political behavior when it suits him  a recurring feature in criticisms of the president. Many of his opponents, too, have trampled American political norms, even as they rush to resist Trump.

Democratic California Rep. Maxine Waters exemplified that tendency on Saturday when she called for liberal mobs to harass Trump administration officials who show their faces in public  a move that earned her a rare rebuke from Democratic leadership.

Waters isnt alone in abandoning political norms to go after Trump.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Partys 2016 presidential nominee, slammed Trump during the campaign for refusing to promise to accept the results of the election. Clinton called Trumps defiance horrifying and said he was talking down our democracy.
