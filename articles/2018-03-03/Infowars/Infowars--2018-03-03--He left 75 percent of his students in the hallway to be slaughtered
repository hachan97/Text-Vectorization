A student who survived the Parkland high school massacre on February 14 accused one of his teachers earlier this week of locking him and over a dozen other kids out in the hallway as the gunman was in the middle of his shooting spree.

Josh Gallagher, a junior from Coral Springs, Florida, posted a scathing message on social media accusing his math teacher, Jim Gard of Pompano Beach, of being a coward.

Gard defended himself, telling the South Florida Sun-Sentinel that he was simply following the rules and that he didnt see any students in the hall.

Im a victim of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting, Gallagher wrote in a Twitter post on Wednesday.

Before the shooting took place I was located in the 700 building which is right next to the freshmen building facing it in my Math class with my Teacher Jim Gard, he writes.
