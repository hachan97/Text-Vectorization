Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student Patrick Petty had a strong message to his classmates who are pushing for stronger gun control legislation: he does not want his slain sisters name used to advocate for their agenda. His reason? She wouldnt have supported their end game.

Pettys sister, Alaina, was in the Stoneman Douglas JROTC program and was one of three JROTC members who died during the Valentines Day massacre.

Most people were supportive of Pettys wish and even understood where he was coming from.

The sad reality is this is what politics is these days.

Pretty likely the three JROTC kids wouldnt have supported it.

Instead theyre asking a few loud, overly vocal older students who were on a different side of the school what they want.

Whats even worse? Gun control advocates SLAMMED Petty because he doesnt agree with them.

Seriously. What the hell is going on with the world?

Shame on Alaina? Shes DEAD and youre dragging her name through the mud because she supported the Second Amendment? Shame on YOU.



 At least someone said it.

You dont know if her views would change. None of us do. Stop acting like youre God.

Thats not heartless or anything.

It must not have occurred to some people that some of these survivors have no ulterior motive. Some of them just want to heal and move on.

Gun control advocates: you cant march for anyone but yourselves. You cant know what each of these students would have wanted. You dont know if they would have agreed with your agenda.
