President Trump slammed critics, talked up tariffs, unveiled his 2020 slogan, brought up executing drug dealers (again) and noted how bored people would be if he acted like a regular old president at a Saturday night rally for Republican Rick Saccone in Moon Township, PA.

Remember I used to say how easy it is to be presidential? Trump reminded the audience. But you would all be out of here right now. You would be so bored. Im very presidential.

Trump then gave a mock-campaign speech where he robotically delivered boring presidential remarks.

See, thats easy. Thats much easier than doing what I have to do, said Trump. But this is much more effective. This got us elected. If I came like a stiff you guys wouldnt be here tonight.

Trump also slammed sleeping son of a bitch Chuck Todd, and very low IQ Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi.

It was 1999. I was on Meet the Press a show now headed by sleepy-eyes Chuck Todd. Hes a sleeping son of a bitch. I tell you.

We have to defeat Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters, a low IQ individual, Trump then said  going back into another impression, this time of Waters:

Do you ever see her? We will impeach him! President Trump said mockingly.

Trump also rolled out his 2020 slogan during the rally; Keep America Great!

But we can only do that if we elect people who are going to back our agenda and fight for our values, he added.
