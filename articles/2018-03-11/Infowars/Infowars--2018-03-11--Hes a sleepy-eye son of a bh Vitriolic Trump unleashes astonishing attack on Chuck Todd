Donald Trump is back on the campaign trail, and back to poking fun at journalists.

This time the president took aim at NBCs Chuck Todd, calling him a sleepy eye son of a b***h as he stood before the crowd in Moon Township, Pennsylvania.

Trump arrived in Pittsburgh to campaign for Republican Rick Saccone, who is neck-and-neck with Democrat Conor Lamb in a special election for the districts vacant house seat.

But, true to fashion, the president spent more time talking about television ratings, fake news, and his own reelection  revealing his 2020 campaign slogan will be Keep America great!

It appears Trump was responding to a tweet from Todd on Saturday afternoon, directly replying to the presidents calls of fake news, when he hit out at the host.

In the first hours after hearing that North Koreas leader wanted to meet with me to talk denuclearization and that missile launches will end, the press was startled and amazed, Trump tweeted.
