This weeks Saturday Night Live opened as a spoof of ABCs The Bachelor, featuring Kate McKinnon as FBI special counsel Robert Mueller.

McKinnons Mueller confronted the contestant, played by Cecily Strong, to tell her he could not commit to finding President Donald Trump guilty of colluding with the Russians in the 2016 presidential election.

The reality is that I dont think I can give you everything that you want right now, McKinnon said.
