A student at Indiana University of Pennsylvania was barred from class, forced to apologize and given an academic referral for disputing the reality of white male privilege.

Lake Ingle said students in his Feb. 28 religious studies class watched a TED Talk by transgender woman Paula Stone Williams. He said only women were allowed to participate in a subsequent discussion.

The floor was opened, and not a single woman spoke, Mr. Ingletold Campus Reform. Thirty seconds or so passed and still no woman had spoken. So, I decided it was permissible for me to enter conversation, especially because I felt the conversation itself was completely inappropriate in its structure.

Mr. Ingle said he disputed several claims in the video, arguing there are only two biological sexes and that the gender wage gap is a myth.
