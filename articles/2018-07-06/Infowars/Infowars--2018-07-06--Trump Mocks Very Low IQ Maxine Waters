President Trump mocked Maxine Waters on Thursday during an epic rally in Montana for Republican US Senate candidate Matt Rosendale.

I said it the other day, yes, she is a low IQ individual, Maxine Waters, Trump said. I said it the other day.

I mean, honestly, shes somewhere in the mid-60s, I believe that, he said to huge laughter.

PRESIDENT TRUMP: I said it the other day, yes, she is a low IQ individual, Maxine Waters. I said it the other day. High  I mean, honestly, shes somewhere in the mid-60s, I believe that.

 (APPLAUSE) He will be impeached. I will impeach him. Even the Democrats are saying, How are you saying that? They dont want to use that word, because it gets the Republicans out to vote. They say, Stay away from that word. Especially since hes done nothing wrong. That helps also, right? Theres no collusion. No collusion. After spending $22 million, its awfully tough. And the House just left and they said, Theres no collusion. Can you imagine this? Its all a ruse. This was an excuse for the Democrats who lost an election, who actually got their ass kicked, 306 to 223, thats a pretty good shellacking  306.

The whole rally was Campaign Trump at his finest:

Its truly remarkable seeing a packed crowd cheering like crazy over what used to be relatively boring policy discussions!
