Special counsel Robert Mueller told President Trumps legal team that he cannot indict a sitting president, according to Rudy Giuliani, one of Trumps attorneys.

All they get to do is write a report, Giuliani told CNN Wednesday. They cant indict. At least they acknowledged that to us after some battling, they acknowledged that to us.

This case is essentially over. Theyre just in denial, Giuliani added, per Fox News.
