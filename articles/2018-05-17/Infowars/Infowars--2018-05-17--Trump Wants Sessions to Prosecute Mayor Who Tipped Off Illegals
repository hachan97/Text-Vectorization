President Trump blasted Californias sanctuary state law for providing safe haven for illegal immigrant drug dealers, gang members, and some of the most vicious and violent offenders on earth, pledging to redouble his administrations efforts to deport illegal immigrants who commit crimes.

Trump on Wednesday met with more than a dozen conservative California officials and sheriffs who oppose the states Democrat-led efforts to block local law enforcements cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

The president thanked the courageous mayors and sheriffs and local leaders from across the state who, he said, bravely resisted Californias deadly and unconstitutional sanctuary state laws.
