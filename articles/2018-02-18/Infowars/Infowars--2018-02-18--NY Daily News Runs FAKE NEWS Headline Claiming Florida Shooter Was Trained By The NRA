In what has been described as one of the most vile, misleading headlines of all time, the left leaning New York Daily News published their Saturday edition with a cover that includes the ridiculous fake news claim that alleged Florida school shooter Nikolas Cruz was actually trained by the NRA themselves.

Apparently aiming to give Democrats an assist with their renewed push to disarm the American people, The NY Daily News latched onto the fact that the JROTC program at the school received funding from the NRA as evidence that the shooter himself received training from them.

The problem? The claim is about as misleading as they come, especially when you consider that while it is true that Cruz was at one time a member of the JROTC, so where dozens of other students, some who even HELPED others get out of the school during the shooting itself!

All the NRA did was give a grant to the JROTC program. They did not train Cruz and, sadly, the leftist propagandists at the NY Daily News are well aware of this fact but are hoping their readers are so uninformed that they believe this actual fake news.

The story itself was specifically designed as a hit piece against an organization that liberals throughout the country have painted as an all powerful, well-funded group when, in reality, anti-gun groups have spent literally hundreds of millions of more dollars than ANY pro-gun group ever has.

Users on Twitter were quick to destroy the fake news cover, making it clear that at least some Americans are able to see through this transparent leftist propaganda.

Make no mistake. ALL those involved with this disgusting hit piece, including the reporters who wrote it, the editors who allowed it, and the punk who wrote the fake news headline are nothing more than leftist propagandists masquerading as journalists.
