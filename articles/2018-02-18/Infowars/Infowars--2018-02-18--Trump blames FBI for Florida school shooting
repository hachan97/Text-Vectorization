President Donald Trump said it was not acceptable that the FBI missed signs the Florida school shooter was going to attack, slamming the agency for spending too much time focusing on the Russian collusion investigation.

After a week during which Robert Mueller appeared to prove Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Trump used the shooting, in which 17 died, including 14 children, to attack the FBI for going after him in the Russian collusion investigation.

And in just one 280 character tweet late Saturday night, he managed to conflate the two biggest national news stories of the week  Russian election interference and the Florida tragedy.

Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter, he tweeted. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign  there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!
