Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he is confident his choice to recuse himself from the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election was a good one.

I believe I did the right thing, the only thing I could do, Sessions told Fox Business Maria Bartiromo in an interview that will air in full Sunday morning on Fox News. She had asked him if he had any regrets in the recusal last year, which elicited the ire of his boss, President Trump.

I participated in this campaign, and as such under explicit regulations of the Department of Justice, no one can participate in the investigation of a campaign in which they were an active participant, added Sessions.
