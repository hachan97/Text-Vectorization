The indictment released today by the grand jury in the investigation headed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller says that after Donald Trump was elected president in 2016 the alleged Russian conspirators in the case, while pretending to be Americans, organized rallies both for and against Trump.

One event they organized in New York City on Nov. 12, 2016 was called Trump is NOT my President. Another event they organized in Charlotte, North Carolina, on November 19, 2016, was called Charlotte Against Trump.

The indictment brings charges against 13 Russian individuals and three Russian companies. In a statement releasing the indictment today, the Department of Justice said: There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in the alleged unlawful activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.

This passage on Page 23 of the indictment cites rallies that the alleged Russian conspirators organized against Trump shortly after he was elected:

Defendants, posing as U.S. persons and creating false U.S. personas, operated social medial pages and groups designed to attract U.S. audiences, says the indictment.

These groups and pages, which addressed divisive U.S. political and social issues, falsely claimed to be controlled by U.S. activists when, in fact, they were controlled by defendants, it says.
