Saturdays White House Correspondents Association dinner, billed as a celebration of the First Amendment and a tribute to journalists who speak truth to power, has to be the worst advertisement in memory for our national press corps.

Comedian Michelle Wolf, the guest speaker, recited one filthy joke after another at the expense of President Trump and his people, using words that would have gotten her kicked out of school not so long ago.

Media critic Howard Kurtz said he had never seen a performance like that, adding that Wolf was not only nasty but dropping F-bombs on live television. Some of her stuff was grungier than that.
