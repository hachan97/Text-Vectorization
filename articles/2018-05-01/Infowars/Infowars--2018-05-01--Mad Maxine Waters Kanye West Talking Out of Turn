Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) lashed out at Kanye West Monday after he recently started promoting conservative ideology, saying, sometimes West talks out of turn.

Talking with a POLITICO reporter, Waters said, Kanye West is a very creative young man. ... But we also think that sometimes West talks out of turn and perhaps he needs some assistance in helping him to formulate some of his thoughts. We dont think that he actually means to do harm, but were not sure he really understands the impact of what hes saying, at the time that hes saying it and how that weighs on, particularly the African-American community  and for young people in general.

Mad Maxine continued, I understand that he is getting pushback from a lot of young people on the internet ... but were hopeful that his creativity will continue to be demonstrated in his work. And I think maybe he should think twice about politics  and maybe not have so much to say.

It all started when Kanye tweeted out support for conservative commentator Candace Owens.

Since then, West has refused to bow to peer pressure and has continued pushing anti-establishment ideology into the mainstream.
