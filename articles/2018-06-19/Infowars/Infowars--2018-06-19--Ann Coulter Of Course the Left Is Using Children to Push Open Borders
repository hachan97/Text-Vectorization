New York Times best-selling author and populist conservative columnist Ann Coulter says it is typical of the establishment media and political Left to use the issue of child border crossers arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border to push their open borders agenda.

In an interview with talk radio host Howie Carr, Coulter said, of course media pundits, the open borders lobby, and Democrats are using President Donald Trumps zero tolerance policy at the border as a way to gain support for their preferred mass immigration and cheap labor economic model.

Who cares if this started under Trump or Obama. What the Lefts argument is: Trump is a liar, therefore we get to wreck your country. No, no these are fake phony frauds. This is a political movement to bring people in. Of course theyre using children. Of course theyre having children weeping and crying. What are we going to do, take in all of Latin America? And by the way, these are the people who say that America itself, Oh, were a hateful country, were misogynist and the rape culture, and were so racist, racist, racist. Theyre always telling us how racist Americans are. Why would you want to bring people into a country thats such a horrible place? [Emphasis added]

During a White House press briefing on Monday evening, a reporter from the establishment media advocated for a border policy that halted all detention of border crossers until the Republican-controlled Congress closed the legal loophole that prevents child border crossers from being detained with their parents, or the adults accompanying them, until they are deported.
