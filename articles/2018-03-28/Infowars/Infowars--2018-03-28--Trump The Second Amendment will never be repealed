President Trump in a tweet early Wednesday said the Second Amendment will never be repealed, despite a former Supreme Court justices words, and called for more Republicans to be elected in this years midterm elections.

THE SECOND AMENDMENT WILL NEVER BE REPEALED! he tweeted.

As much as Democrats would like to see this happen, and despite the words yesterday of former Supreme Court Justice Stevens, NO WAY, he added.

We need more Republicans in 2018 and must ALWAYS hold the Supreme Court!

Trump tweet follows an op-ed from former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, who said that the Second Amendment is outdated and misunderstood.

Stevens, a Republican, wrote in The New York Times on Tuesday said that students and anti-gun violence advocates should press lawmakers to enact legislation prohibiting civilian ownership of semiautomatic weapons, increasing the minimum age to buy a gun from 18 to 21 years old, and establishing more comprehensive background checks on all purchasers of firearms.
