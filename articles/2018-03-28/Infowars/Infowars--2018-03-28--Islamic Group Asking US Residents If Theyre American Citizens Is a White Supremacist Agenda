The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) is the latest left-wing organization to lambast the Commerce Departments decision to begin asking United States residents on the 2020 Census if they are American citizens.

This week, President Trumps administration announced in a historic decision that it would put the citizenship question back on the U.S. Census  a question that has not been included since 1950  a move that will provide Americans with more accurate data on unemployment, the number of citizens in the country, and a better look into the foreign-born population.

The open borders lobby, though, is blasting the decision, as it threatens states with large illegal alien populations like California, New York, and Florida. Those states are at risk of losing congressional seats if redistricting is based upon counting citizens rather than the current model, which counts all residents, including illegal aliens.

CAIR  an organization that has repeatedly defended suspected terrorists  says that merely asking U.S. residents if they are citizens is a white supremacist agenda. The organization wrote in a statement, This is yet another political move by the Trump administration to implement its white supremacist agenda and to drag our nation back to the false white paradise of the 1950s.
