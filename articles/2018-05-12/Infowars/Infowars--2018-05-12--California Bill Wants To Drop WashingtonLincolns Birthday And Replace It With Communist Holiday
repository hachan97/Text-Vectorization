The California Assembly discussed Thursday a bill that would replace Abraham Lincoln or George Washingtons birthday with International Socialist Workers Day as a paid holiday.

California Democrat Assemblyman Miguel Santiago introduced Bill AB-3042, which would allow schools to replace Washington Day and Lincoln Day with Presidents Day and install an International Workers Day  conventionally known as May Day  as a second holiday.

Im aghast that a bill like this would be able to get through committee, California Republican Assemblyman Matthew Harper said to the Assembly. Are we in competition to be the laughing stock of the United States?

Are we going that far to the left? Harper asked. This is ridiculous; this is insane; this is un-American. And for folks who think that the U.S. won the Cold War with the Soviet Union, this makes it sound like were going in the other direction  that indeed California is kowtowing to the Soviet domination of the Cold War.
