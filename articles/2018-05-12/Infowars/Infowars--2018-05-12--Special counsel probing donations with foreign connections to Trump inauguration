Special counsel Robert Muellers team has questioned several witnesses about millions of dollars in donations to President Donald Trumps inauguration committee last year, including questions about donors with connections to Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, sources with direct knowledge told ABC News.

Those interviewed included longtime Trump friend and confidant Thomas Barrack, who oversaw the fundraising effort, as well as individuals familiar with the massive inaugural fund, according to sources with direct knowledge.

Barrack, a real estate investor, has long been described as a Trump whisperer whose close friendship with the president landed him a prime appearance during the GOP convention the night Trump accepted his partys nomination.

The billionaire runs a fund with hundreds of millions in real estate and private equity holdings in the Middle East. Barrack oversaw the largest inaugural fundraising effort in U.S. history, bringing in $107 million  more than double what President Barack Obama raised for his first swearing-in festivities.
