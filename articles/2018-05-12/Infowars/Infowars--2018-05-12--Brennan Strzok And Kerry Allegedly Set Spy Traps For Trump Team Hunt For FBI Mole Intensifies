Yesterday we reported on a disturbing op-ed in the Wall Street Journal by Kimberly Strassel suggesting the FBI had a mole within the Trump campaign.

After a battle between House Intel Committee Chair Devin Nunes (R-CA) and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein over the release of classified information that was so top-secret that the DOJ refused to show Nunes on the grounds that it could risk lives by potentially exposing the source, a U.S. citizen who has provided intelligence to the CIA and FBI  the agency finally relented on Wednesday, allowing Nunes and Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) to receive a classified briefing.

This U.S. citizen, according the WSJ report, is a spy that the FBI embedded in the Trump campaign  and Strassel says she knows who it is but wont say.

I believe I know the name of the informant, but my intelligence sources did not provide it to me and refuse to confirm it. It would therefore be irresponsible to publish it.

In February, The Last Refuge reported that Trump campaign advisor Carter Page was working as an under-cover employee (UCE) for the FBI  helping the agency build a case against Evgeny Buryakov, Then  seven months later, the FBI told a FISA court Page was a spy.

In April 2017, writing a story about Carter Page (trying to enhance/affirm the Russian narrative), the New York Times outlined Pages connections to the Trump campaign.  However, New York Times also references Pages prior connection to the Buryakov case. If you ignore the narrative, you discover the UCE1 description is Carter Page.

When asked over Twitter by OANNs Jack Posobiec whether it was him, Page denied the charge  replying But if what Im hearing alleged is correct, its a guy I know who splits most his time between inside the Beltway and in one of the other Five Eyes countries, adding And if so, itd be typical: swamp creatures putting themselves first.
