A UK Euromillions ticket-holder has become the country's third biggest lottery winner of all time, after scooping a jackpot of more than 121m.

Tuesday's winning numbers were 20, 23, 28, 30, 44, with Lucky Stars 03 and 07.

The biggest lottery prize in UK history is the 161m Euromillions jackpot won by North Ayrshire couple Chris and Colin Weir in 2011.

In August 2012, Adrian and Gillian Bayford, from Haverhill, Suffolk, won more than 148m.

Euromillions is played in nine countries - the UK, Austria, Belgium, France, the Irish Republic, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland - with ticket-holders trying to win a share of the same jackpot.

The total Euromillions jackpot on Tuesday was 121,328,187, UK lottery operator Camelot said.

Previous winners of the Euromillions jackpot include a couple from Largs in Ayrshire.

Chris and Colin Weir won the 161m prize, which was one of Europe's biggest, in July 2011.

Mr Weir described the win as "a dream".

"When we first realised we had won, it felt like a dream," he said at the time. "Everything went into slow motion."

"The next steps are going to be the most difficult... with great wealth comes great responsibility," added Mr Weir.
