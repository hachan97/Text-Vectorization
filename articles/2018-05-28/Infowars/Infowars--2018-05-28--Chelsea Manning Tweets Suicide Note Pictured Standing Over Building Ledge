Government whistleblower and Democratic Senate candidate Chelsea Manning tweeted a suicide note and picture of himself standing over the ledge of a tall building on Sunday.

Im sorry  I tried  Im sorry I let you all down  Im not really cut out for this world  I tried adapting to this world out here but I failed you  I couldnt do this anymore  I can take people I dont know hating me but not my own friends  I tried and Im sorry about my failure, said Mannings now-deleted note.

Manning then posted a photo of himself standing over the ledge of a tall building.

A tweet was later posted on Mannings account saying he was safe, and the suicidal tweets were removed.

Though its unclear what specifically compelled Manning to act out, its reasonable to assume bullying and and rejection had something to do with it, based on the suicide note.

Manning first gained notoriety after leaking hundreds of thousands of State Department documents to WikiLeaks, and was imprisoned in 2011 until former President Obama commuted his 35-year sentence in 2017.

Manning changed his name from Bradley to Chelsea in 2014 after coming out as transgender.
