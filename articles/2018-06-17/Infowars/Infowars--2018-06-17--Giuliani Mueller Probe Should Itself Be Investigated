President Donald Trumps attorney said Special Counsel Robert Muellers probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election should itself be the subject of a Justice Department examination.

We want the Mueller probe to be investigated the way the Trump administration has been investigated, and wed like to see a report with the conclusions, Rudy Giuliani said Sunday on CNNs State of the Union.

The comments follow his statements on Friday that the presidents legal team was looking into a Justice Department inspector generals report to determine whether they could make a case that Muellers investigation is invalid because of findings of bias at the FBI.
