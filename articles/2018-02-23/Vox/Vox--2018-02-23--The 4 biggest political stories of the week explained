With Congress out of session, relatively little officially happened this week in American politics, leaving the ghosts of past events to dominate the scene. The massacre in Parkland, Florida, continued to lead the agenda and spurred the Trump administration to roll out a set of new proposals  some pro-gun and some in the direction of gun control  though the actual prospects for anything happening remain very uncertain.

Robert Muellers investigation continues to move forward, sweeping more people into its wake, and so does the administrations regulatory war on the Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court handed down a ruling that could prove decisive in Novembers battle for control of Congress.

Heres what you need to know.

Facing increased public pressure in the wake of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the Trump administration rolled out some new policy ideas  including, strikingly for a Republican, a few ideas that would restrict gun rights:

Special counsel Robert Mueller followed up Fridays indictment of more than a dozen Russian individuals and entities with the announcement of a guilty plea from former Skadden Arps attorney Alex van der Zwaan for making false statements to the FBI, and then another one from Rick Gates. The Russians almost certainly wont ever stand trial (they are in Russia), and van der Zwaan is a very peripheral player, but both moves suggest an intensifying effort to raise pressure on the actual key figures in the case.

New regulations promulgated on Tuesday by the Department of Health and Human Services are going to greatly expand insurance companies ability to opt out of Affordable Care Act regulatory requirements, likely offering lower premiums to healthy young buyers but making actual access to health care for people who get sick more difficult.

In the wake of an earlier decision to deem partisan gerrymandering a violation of the state constitution, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court drew a new, more balanced map for its US House of Representatives districts that is cheering Democrats and angering Republicans.
