Several Palm Beach County, Fla., police officers are guarding the home of the former school resource deputy who stayed outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School as last weeks massacre unfolded, Foxs WSVN-TV reported.

Deputy Scot Peterson, of the Broward County Sheriffs Office, was armed and stationed on the schools campus when a suspect identified by authorities as Nikolas Cruz opened fire with an AR-15 rifle, leaving 17 people dead and others wounded.

Peterson resigned Thursday after video surveillance showed he never entered the school, even though he clearly knew there was a shooting taking place, officials said. The revelation prompted widespread outrage.

We sent @BrianEntin to BSO Deputy Scot Petersons Boynton Beach home to try and talk to him about his resignation today. Were met by 6 @PBCountySheriff deputies standing guard outside his home. They prevented us from approaching the house.
