Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe lied four times, including to James Comey, about his authorization of leaks to the media, according to a Republican lawmaker familiar with an internal FBI report recommending McCabes firing.

He didnt lie just once; he lied four times, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan told Fox News Laura Ingraham on Thursday.

Four times he lied. He lied to James Comey. He lied to the [FBIs] Office of Professional Responsibility, and he lied twice under oath to the inspector general.

Jordan, a Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee, told The Daily Caller News Foundation earlier on Thursday the Office of Professional Responsibility report revealed McCabe not only did not tell Comey he authorized leaks to the media, he affirmatively denied he did so.
