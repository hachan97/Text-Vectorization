The weirdness of covering politics in Donald Trumps Washington is that you can have what feels like a slow week in national politics also be a week in which a Cabinet secretary got fired. After all, the secretary of veterans affairs isnt like a top-five most important Cabinet secretary or anything.

But with somewhat less heat than usual emanating from the nations capital, there was a chance for a wider range of actors  from Oklahoma teachers to Florida high school students  to make their voices heard. And never fear, Trump said some weird stuff too.

Heres what you need to know.

The much-anticipated ouster of Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin finally happened late Wednesday afternoon, paired with the much more surprising announcement that Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson, the chief White House physician, will be nominated to replace him.

Inspired by successful labor action in West Virginia, Oklahomas K-12 teachers say theyll go on strike starting Monday unless they get a bigger raise than the state legislature seems willing to offer.

After last weekends well-received speeches at the large and well-organized March for Our Lives in Washington, DC, the teenage Parkland massacre survivors whove become gun control activists became the target of some oddly personal criticism from top conservative media figures. And then the kids fought back.

In Ohio allegedly to tout his administrations infrastructure plan, Trump delivered one of the rambling, factually challenged addresses for which hes famous. This one including what was, on its face, a major foreign policy announcement.
