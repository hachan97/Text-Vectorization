On Friday, it was revealed that U.S. Capitol Police arrested a male Democratic operative for allegedly assaulting a female Trump administration official after a House budget hearing on Thursday.

The alleged assault took place at the conclusion of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinkes testimony on the departments 2019 budget proposal before the House Committee on Natural Resources, the DCNF reported.

The suspect supposedly identified himself as a reporter with the David Brock-founded American Bridge, which is a progressive research and communications organization committed to holding Republicans accountable for their words and actions.
