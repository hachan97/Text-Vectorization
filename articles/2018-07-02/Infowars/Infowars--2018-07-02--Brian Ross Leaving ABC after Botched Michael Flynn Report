ABC News Brian Ross  who was suspended last year as chief investigative correspondent for a faulty report on Michael Flynn  is leaving the network, Page Six has exclusively learned.

ABC suspended Ross last December for a month without pay for a botched report on ousted White House national security adviser Flynn that reported President Trump directed Flynn to make contact with Russian officials. The mistake even sent stocks tumbling, and ABC issued an apology saying: We deeply regret and apologize for the serious error.

We hear that Ross on Monday announced hes leaving the network. His longtime executive producer Rhonda Schwartz is also exiting. The time has come to say good-bye, said the duo in a letter to staff with an announcement by ABC News president James Goldston.
