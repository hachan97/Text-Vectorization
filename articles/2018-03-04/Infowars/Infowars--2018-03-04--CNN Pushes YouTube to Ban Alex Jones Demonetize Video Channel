Right-wing broadcaster Alex Jones announced Saturday evening that YouTube had frozen his video channel and would delete it on Sunday, after CNN pursued the social media giant and its advertisers.

The announcement came just hours after CNN published a story, Advertisers flee InfoWars founder Alex Jones YouTube channel, in which journalists Paul P. Murphy and Gianluca Mezzofiore approached companies to explain why their ads were showing up on Alex Joness channel.

Murphy and Mezzofiore also asked YouTube why it had not filtered out certain advertisers from showing up on the channel due to its offensive content.

The CNN article reads less like coverage of news and more like a chronicle of an activist campaign to damage Joness channel. Many of the brands  including Nike, Moen, Expedia, Acer, ClassPass, Honey, Alibaba and OneFamily  have suspended ads on InfoWars channels after being contacted by CNN for comment, the authors noted.

On Saturday evening, Jones tweeted: The Alex Jones channel with billions of views is frozen. We have been told it will be deleted tomorrow and all 33 thousands videos will be erased.
