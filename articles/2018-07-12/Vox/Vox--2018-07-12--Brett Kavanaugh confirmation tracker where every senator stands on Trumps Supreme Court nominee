The odds are in favor of the US Senate confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.

Most Republicans senators have quickly lined up behind Kavanaugh, who would surely swing the Courts ideology to the right. They have either endorsed him outright or heaped praise on Trumps nominee, while noting that they take their judicial confirmation responsibility seriously. Even moderates Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Susan Collins (R-ME)  the Republicans most likely on the fence  have spoken favorably of the Kavanaugh.
