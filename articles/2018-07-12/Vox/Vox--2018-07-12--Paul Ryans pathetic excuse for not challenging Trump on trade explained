Speaking to reporters Thursday morning at the Economic Club of Washington, House Speaker Paul Ryan had three clear messages on trade: He thinks the Trump administrations trade wars are misguided, he doesnt intend to do anything about it, and he is a deeply dishonest person who is committed to pretending that theres nothing he can do about it.

Heres the reality. Back in September of 2016, the Obama administration vetoed a bill that was supported by large bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress. Consequently, Congress voted to override his veto.

Veto overrides are rare because they require two-thirds support in both houses of Congress, and its unusual for a president to take an action with such a low level of congressional support. But by the same token, its very unusual for a president to take an action that gets denounced by his own partys leader in the House of Representatives.

If Paul Ryan and other congressional Republicans whove long supported free trade wanted to write legislation curtailing Trumps ability to invoke spurious national security claims to raise taxes on imported goods, it seems overwhelmingly likely that they would be able to get the votes to do so.

The big question would, in fact, be whether Democrats  who as a congressional caucus have generally been much more skeptical of trade  would bail Trump out by upholding his veto. Given both the prevailing anti-Trump sentiment in the party and the reality that nobody can see any real strategy behind Trumps trade approach, that seems unlikely to me, though its certainly possible.

But Ryan is voluntarily surrendering without a shot, all while pretending that he has no choice.
