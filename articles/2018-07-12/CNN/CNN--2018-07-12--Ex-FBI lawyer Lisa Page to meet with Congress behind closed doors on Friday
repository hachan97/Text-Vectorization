Page initially defied a congressional subpoena Wednesday , with her lawyer citing a lack of information on the scope of the interview and an inability to view materials produced to lawmakers before the interview. Republicans, at the time, were considering holding her in contempt of Congress.

Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican, said in a statement on Thursday that Page will appear before the House Judiciary and Oversight Committee for a transcribed interview on Friday at 1:30 p.m., which will continue on Monday. Page's attorney Amy Jeffress has confirmed the meeting.

Page and FBI agent Peter Strzok have been ensnared in a Republican firestorm for months over text messages they exchanged disparaging Donald Trump while working on the Hillary Clinton email probe and Russia investigations. Her attorney said Wednesday there is "no basis for claims that Lisa has anything to hide or is unwilling to testify." Page has since left the agency.

Goodlatte in his statement called Page's decision to participate in the interview "long overdue."

"As part of the Committees' joint investigation into decisions made by the Justice Department in 2016, we have sought her testimony for seven months, ultimately resulting in a subpoena demanding her presence," the statement said. "Lisa Page is a key witness in our investigation and we need to hear from her about her role related to certain decisions made by the Department and Bureau."
