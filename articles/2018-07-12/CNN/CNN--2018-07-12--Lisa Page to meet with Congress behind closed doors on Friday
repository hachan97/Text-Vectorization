Page initially defied a congressional subpoena Wednesday , with her lawyer citing a lack of information on the scope of the interview and an inability to view materials produced to lawmakers before the interview. Republicans, at the time, were considering holding her in contempt of Congress.

But on CNN's "New Day" Thursday morning, House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican, said that Page's lawyer Amy Jeffress reached an agreement late Wednesday night for Page to give private testimony to the Judiciary Committee on Friday. Page's attorney confirmed Goodlatte's comments.

Page and FBI agent Peter Strzok have been ensnared in a Republican firestorm for months over text messages they exchanged disparaging Donald Trump while working on the Hillary Clinton email probe and Russia investigations. Her attorney said Wednesday there is "no basis for claims that Lisa has anything to hide or is unwilling to testify." Page has since left the agency.

Page will not appear with Strzok during his testimony before the House Judiciary and Oversight Committee Thursday morning, Ranking House Judiciary Democrat Jerrold Nadler told CNN. Before agreeing to meet with members of Congress on Friday, Republicans had offered Page the opportunity to appear beside Strzok at his public hearing Thursday.
