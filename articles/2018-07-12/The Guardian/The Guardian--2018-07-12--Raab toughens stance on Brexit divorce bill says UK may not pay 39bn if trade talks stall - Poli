Business leaders have said the Brexit white paper put vital meat on the bones of the Chequers plan but have said there are key gaps on VAT and details customs arrangements.

They have also said it is now critical that the EU engages with plan and takes Theresa Mays efforts to find unity seriously.

It is a make or break summer, said the CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn. It is a race against time.

The CBI welcomed the direction of travel and said the white paper reflects much of the evidence that business has been highlighting.

It said the common rule book would go a long way to achieving the frictionless trade they need to protect business and jobs but stressed the ball was now in the EUs court.

It is now the EUs turn to put economics before ideology on these proposals, said Fairbairn. She went on:

The Institute of Directors director general Stephen Martin said the details on the customs and trade proposals would narrow the scope EU negotiators had to claim they could not push ahead because there was no plan from the UK.

But he said the government has missed a trick by holding back on detail in several areas calling for more clarity on VAT arrangements.

It also criticised the government for not detailing the dispute resolution system that would operate for business when outside the ECJs purview.
