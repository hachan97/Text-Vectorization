A friend of the Florida school shooting suspect told Good Morning America on Tuesday that Nikolaz Cruz talked about killing people regularly and she and others warned the school repeatedly about him.

He talked about killing our parents, our friends, boyfriends, and girlfriends, Ariana Lopez said on ABCs Good Morning America.

Lopez said that while her friendship with Cruz started out normally,  she soon noticed he would often display weapons and post disturbing pictures online.

He used to sell knives out of his lunchbox, which I thought was insane because this is a school. Hes like, hey guys, want some knives?' she said. He would talk about how he sympathized with Syrian terrorists, and how those who opposed him should be killed. He posted pictures of 15 or more firearms just on his bed, she added.
