Anti-gun activist and Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school student David Hogg interviewed classmates about gun control during what was believed to be the actual shooting.

However, unedited video shows Hogg saying hes recording the interview at 9:32 on February 14th, 2018, almost 4 hours before the shooting took place.

Is it possible he was recording at 9:32 P.M.?

Scroll to 0:57 This is Alex View, this recording is taken at 9:32 on February 14th 2018, Hogg says. Alex, are you ok with me recording this? Yes, I am ok with you recording this, Alex responds. I personally have rallied for gun rights and less control, not necessarily less control but this experience has definitely changed my viewpoint, she says. What experience? The shooting drill, or the actual shooting that hasnt happened yet? I wanted to be a junior NRA member, I wanted to learn how to hunt, I was always fascinated by guns as a young girl, but this experience was so traumatizing to the point where now I cant even fathom the idea of a gun in my house. If that isnt strange enough, theres more that corroborates the time discrepancy. In another video, Hogg whispers, An hour into school. An active shooter. Its not a drill. An hour into school would typically be about 9:30am. But then he goes on to say, its 2:52. I heard one gunshot and we thought it was a drill initially, but its not.
