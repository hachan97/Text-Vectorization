In a hilarious twist of fate, MSNBC anchor Joy Ann Reid, who has repeatedly called out Russian election meddling, was the favorite pundit of the Russian trolls indicted by Robert Mueller.

Reid, who hosts a weekend show on the network, received the most retweets of any pundit from the Russian troll farm, according to a review by Law and Crime.

Donald Trump received the most retweets in 2016 overall, at 578, while Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders received 27.

Reid received 267 total retweets by the Russian trolls. While thats only about half as many retweets as the president, the irony is especially thick given her constant accusations that the president colluded with Russia in order to win the election.

Reid likely became a target for the Russians because they chose to promote people who thought could sow division in the country. Reid has attacked Christians, denounced Christmas bonuses for her employees, spread fake news on several occasions, joked about Nazis, and claimed the Trump era is the worst time to be a human.
