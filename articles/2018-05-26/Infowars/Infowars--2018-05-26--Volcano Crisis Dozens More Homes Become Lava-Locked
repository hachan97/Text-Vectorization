The Number of houses and buildings destroyed by Hawaiis erupting Kilauea volcano has skyrocketed in recent days, as more than 80 structures have now been ruined by the lava.

A total of 82 buildings have now been damaged, a huge jump from 50 only a few days ago.

They cannot be accessed, and anybody who chooses not to evacuate could find themselves trapped by 30-foot-tall walls of lava.
