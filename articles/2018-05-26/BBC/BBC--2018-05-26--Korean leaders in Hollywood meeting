South Korea has made a movie-style video showing its president, Moon Jae-in, meet his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong-un, for only the second time.

It comes as the two sides continue efforts to put a historic US-North Korea summit back on track.

On Thursday US President Donald Trump cancelled the summit, scheduled for 12 June, but later suggested it might still go ahead.
