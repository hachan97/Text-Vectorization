Despite posts allegedly made by the Austin bomber asserting that the attacks were not political, the left wasted little time in hysterically blaming the violence on white terrorism anyway.

Authorities named the suspect as 23-year-old Mark Anthony Conditt following a confrontation with police during which Conditt blew himself up.

In an old blog post by Conditt wrote that he was, not that politically inclined.

I view myself as a conservative, but I dont think I have enough information to defend my stance as well as it should be defended, wrote Conditt.

Before he was tracked down, the bomber also allegedly posted on Reddit that the attacks were not race-related like the media has speculated.

Conditt allegedly wrote that he was doing this simply because I want to watch the world burn, a reference to the terrorism carried out by The Joker in the Batman movie The Dark Knight, which was not politically motivated.

The bomber also compared himself to the Zodiac Killer, whose murders were also not politically motivated.

Despite all this, as soon as Conditt was named, the left began screeching hysterically about him being a white terrorist, despite authorities not yet uncovering a motive.

Once again, leftists seem incapable of Googling the definition of the word terrorist, which is a person who uses unlawful violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.

Since nobody yet knows whether Conditt was motivated by political aims, he cannot be described as a terrorist (unlike Muslim terrorists who almost always yell Allahu Akbar when they are carrying out their attacks.

Conditt may well turn out to be a terrorist, but the lefts rush to impugn all white people for the attacks while imagining some kind of vast white supremacist conspiracy to keep Conditts motive a secret is just another example of their relentless racist hysteria.
