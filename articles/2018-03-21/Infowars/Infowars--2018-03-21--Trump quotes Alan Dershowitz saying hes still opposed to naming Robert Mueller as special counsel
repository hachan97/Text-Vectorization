President Trump tweeted a quote Wednesday morning from Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, who said he was opposed to the selection of special counsel Robert Mueller and claimed there were no crimes to be found in the Russian probe.

Special Council is told to find crimes, whether a crime exist or not. I was opposed the the selection of Mueller to be Special Council, I still am opposed to it. I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime, collusion or otherwise, or obstruction of justice! So stated by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, Trump posted in two consecutive tweets.

Dershowitz made his comments to anchor Lou Dobbs on Fox Business Tuesday night.
