Rep. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) proposed building a border wall between California and Arizona to protect the state.

As we look in Arizona, we often look into the dangers of the southern border, McSally said during a round-table discussion about sanctuary cities Tuesday at the White House.

Sanctuary cities are municipalities that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

But if these dangerous policies continue out of California, we might need to build a wall between California and Arizona as well to keep these dangerous criminals out of our state, she said, smiling.
