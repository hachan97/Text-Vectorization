Few things delight President Trump more than watching Democrats run away from Hillary Clinton.

And the president believes Republican candidates in this years midterm elections should put Democrats aversion for their partys former standard-bearer to the test.

Democrats never have been more vulnerable because theyve lost touch with normal, everyday working people, the president said at a GOP fundraising dinner Tuesday night. Democrats havent learned. They still think the loyal citizens who care about jobs and borders and security are deplorable.

He was referring to Mrs. Clintons infamous remark during the 2016 campaign that half of Trump supporters belonged in a basket of deplorables.
