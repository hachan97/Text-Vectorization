Rep. Beto ORourke (D-Texas)  who is challenging Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for his Senate seat this year  agreed with late-night host Bill Maher who called Cruz an asshole.

Well, dont forget hes a giant asshole, the Real Time with Bill Maher host said on Friday night.

During his interview with Meher, ORourke made his case for why he can land a Senate seat in a state that hasnt elected a Democrat to statewide office since the 1990s.

ORourke, who outraised Cruz in the first months of 2018, said his campaign isnt accepting money from PACs and touted his strategy to visit all of the states counties.
