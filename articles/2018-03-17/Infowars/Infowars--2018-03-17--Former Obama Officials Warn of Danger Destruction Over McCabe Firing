Top officials from the Obama administration condemned President Trump for the abrupt firing of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

Less than 48 hours before McCabe, a 21-year veteran of the bureau, was set to formally retire and collect a full pension, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that he had been terminated.

Eric Holder, who served as former President Barack Obamas attorney general, called his ouster dangerous.

Analyze McCabe firing on two levels: the substance and the timing, Holder tweeted. We dont know enough about the substance yet. The timing appears cruel and a cave that compromised DOJ independence to please an increasingly erratic President who shouldve played no role here. This is dangerous.
