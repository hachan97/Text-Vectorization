Three students at an Arkansas high school were reportedly punished with paddles this week after leaving school to participate in the national walkout to protest gun violence.

According to multiple reports, the Greenbrier, Ark., high school students were given the choice between in-school suspension or corporal punishment, known as paddling.

A parent of one of the students tweeted about the students choice, adding in a follow-up tweet that the students were swatted two times on the bum with [a] wooden paddle.
