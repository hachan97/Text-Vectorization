Hallelujah! Last night former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe was actually fired on the recommendation of Inspector General Michael Horowitz  himself an Obama holdover.

Im still waiting to see McCabe and his fellow Clinton cronies indicted for treason though.

Still, I cant help but remember that Attorney General Sessions had wanted to fire McCabe months ago, but back then FBI Director Wray threatened to cause a political s***storm by quitting himself if McCabe was fired.

And that was before we found out about the missing Strzok/Page text messages which continued to be lost on Wrays watch as well as about the unheeded warnings to the FBI which allowed the Parkland shooter to kill 17.

Now, the Trump administration has a small window in which to fire Wray and they shouldnt miss the opportunity. Any DOJ scumbag who would threaten to harm the administration in order to protect his/her fellow DOJ scumbag(s) needs to go. And if Wray were to be fired now, I doubt it would cause that much of a dust-up considering the above. Indeed, Florida Governor Rick Scott called for Wrays departure after the Parkland tragedy.

Wray picked his allies and made his bed. Now its time for him to lay in it.
