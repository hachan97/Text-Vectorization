Recently fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said if he faces criminal prosecution, hes going to take down everyone else involved in FBI and DoJ wrongdoing related to the Hillary Clinton email probe with him, according to reporter Sarah Carter.

McCabe is worried. And one thing that I did hear is that McCabe has said over and over again, If I go down, Im taking everybody else with me,' Carter said on The Ingraham Angle on Friday.

Plain and simple, he lied. A lot of current and former FBI agents that Ive spoken to said I hope hes fired. Is he going to get fired today? Thats all I kept hearing all day because they realize that if they had done this, they would have been fired too.

McCabe released a statement in reaction to his ouster, claiming his firing was an effort to undermine FBI special counsel Muellers investigation into Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.

This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally, he said in the statement.

It is part of this Administrations ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel investigation, which continue to this day. Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the Special Counsels work.

This report may explain why Obama officials like former CIA Director John Brennan unleashed extreme attacks on President Trump following the news Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe on Friday night: hes worried he may go down with McCabe for his role in misleading the FISA court about the accuracy and origins of the Steele dossier.
