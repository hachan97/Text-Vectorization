Over the past few weeks, the name Stormy Daniels has made constant appearances in the news. Daniels, an adult film star whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, claims to have had a year-long affair with Donald Trump beginning shortly after his wife, Melania, gave birth to their son Barron in 2006. The White House has denied the affair ever happened  despite mounting evidence of a nondisclosure agreement and a $130,000 payout  but the story has snowballed into an investigation of potential misuse of campaign funds.

The coverage of this story has been very focused on this as a sex scandal, explains Laura McGann, Voxs politics editor. But its a story about campaign finance, corruption, and how our politics are changing under Donald Trump. Yes, the main character is an adult film actress, but its bigger than that.
