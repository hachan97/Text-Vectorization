Grand Slam winners Rory Best and Rob Kearney have signed IRFU contract extensions to the end of the 2019 World Cup in Japan.

Ulster hooker Best and Leinster full-back Kearney are the only two Ireland players to feature in both the 2009 and 2018 Grand Slams.

"I feel I can continue to make a contribution to both Ireland and Ulster Rugby," said Ireland captain Best.

"I'm delighted to have extended my contract to the next World Cup."

Best, 35, took over the captaincy before the 2016 Six Nations and he is Ireland's third most-capped player.

Under his stewardship Ireland recorded their first win over the Springboks on South African soil as well as clinching a first ever victory over New Zealand in Chicago in 2016.

Best secured his second Grand Slam success by leading Ireland to a 24-15 victory England at Twickenham on Saturday.

Kearney made his Ireland debut against Argentina in June 2007 and has won 83 caps, scoring 13 tries and a conversion.

He started every match of the successful 2014 and 2015 championship campaigns as well as every game of the 2009 and 2018 Grand Slam seasons.

The two-time Lions tourist (2009 & 2013) has won three Heineken Cups with Leinster and was ERC Player of the Year in 2012.

"I am delighted to have extended my IRFU contract and look forward to continuing to achieve with this Ireland squad," said the 31-year-old.

"There have been some fantastic days for both Ireland and Leinster over the course of my career and there is huge potential for growth in both squads as we look to build and develop and challenge for honours."
