Fox News Tucker Carlson spoke frankly on Monday about demographic change in the United States.

Now, before you start calling anyone bigoted...

A recent piece in National Geographic tells you a lot about demographics in America, and about how bewilderingly fast theyre changing without any real public debate on the subject, The Daily Caller co-founder said.

The magazine profiles the small coal mining town of Hazleton, Pennsylvania. In the year 2000, Hazletons  population was 2 percent Hispanic. Just 16 years later, Hazleton is majority Hispanic. Thats a lot of change. People who grew up in Hazleton return to find out they cant communicate with the people who now live there. And thats bewildering for people. Thats happening all over the country. No nation, no society has ever changed this much, this fast.

Now, before you start calling anyone bigoted, consider and be honest, how would you feel if that happened in your neighborhood? It doesnt matter how nice the immigrants are. They probably are nice. Most immigrants are nice, thats not the point. The point isthis is more change than human beings are designed to digest. This pace of change makes societies volatilereally volatile, just as ours has become volatile.
