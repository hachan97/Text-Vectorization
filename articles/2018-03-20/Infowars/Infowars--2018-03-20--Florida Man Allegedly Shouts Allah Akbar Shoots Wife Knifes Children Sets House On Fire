A Florida man allegedly shouted Allah Akbar repeatedly as police arrested him for shooting his wife, stabbing his two children, and setting his house ablaze.

Police arrested Ronnie Oneal, who identifies as a member of The Nation of Islam, at the house of his partner Kenyatta Barron, in Riverview, Fla., in response to a 911 call from Barron claiming that she had been shot, according to Tampa Bay Times.

Officers found Barron dying of a gunshot wound in the front yard of a neighboring house. Firefighters were responding to a fire set in Barrons house and found Barron and Oneals 9-year-old son, Ronnie Oneal IV, alive but suffering from burns and stab wounds and the couples 11-year-old daughter dead from stab wounds.
