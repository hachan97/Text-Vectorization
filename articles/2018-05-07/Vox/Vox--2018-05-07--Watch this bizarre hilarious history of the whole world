You have been in development for literally billions of years.

Thankfully, you dont have to be around for billions of years to understand how that happened and how you got here. In a video from last year, YouTube creator Bill Wurtz manages to capture the history of the world in a bizarre but highly entertaining 20 minutes.

Wurtz starts with a simple observation: Hi. Youre on a rock, floating in space. Pretty cool, huh? From there, he goes into a deep dive of world history: the formation of the universe; the development of our solar system and Earth; the evolution of species, including humans; the dawn of civilization; the creation of religions; wars; the explosion of technology  and the global population  in the past two centuries; and much, much more.

The video does not contain every single detail of world history. After all, thats just not possible to capture in even 20 minutes. It doesnt go too deep into, for example, how the Black Death ravaged Europe or how Genghis Khans empire killed so much of the worlds population.

But it does manage to capture the big points in a way thats typical of Wurtzs videos: funny, a bit satirical, and very informative. And it does so in a way thats not too focused on the West and America  also (briefly) covering the history of powers like China, Persia, and India, which dont get that much attention in a typical world history class in America.

If one video isnt enough for you, Wurtzs previous history video focused on Japan, and its also highly entertaining and worth watching. And if you want to learn more about the topics Wurtz goes into, there are plenty of podcasts  such as The History of Rome, History of Japan Podcast, Revolutions, and BackStory  that are worth listening to.
