A slew of polls conducted in April show a shrinking level of support for special counsel Robert Muellers probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Recent polls from Monmouth University, Quinnipiac University and Maris indicate Americans are souring on the wide-ranging probe. People are starting to see Muellers investigation as unfair to President Donald Trump, two of the three also suggest.

Monmouths May 1 survey finds 54 percent of Americans believe the special counsels pursuit should continue, which is down from 60 percent in March and 62 percent in July. Nearly 43 percent think the investigation should end  up 10 points since last summer.

Support among independents for continuing the Russia investigation has declined from 63 percent in March to 54 percent in the new poll, indicating criticisms are catching beyond Trumps die-hard conservative base. The results of Monmouths poll, which sampled 803 adults reached through cell phones and landlines, could raise red flags among Democrats hoping to court independents.
