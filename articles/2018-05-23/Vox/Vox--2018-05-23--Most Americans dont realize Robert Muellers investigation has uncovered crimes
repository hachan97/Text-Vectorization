A majority of Americans  59 percent  say in a new survey that Robert Muellers investigation into Russia and the 2016 campaign has not yet uncovered evidence of any crimes, even though in reality, Mueller has already obtained five guilty pleas and 17 criminal indictments.

Thats according to a new survey from Navigator Research that looks at Americans view of the probe and ought to reshape the debate over the Russia investigations role in both media coverage and Democratic Party messaging.

To be as clear about this as possible, Muellers investigation has absolutely uncovered evidence of crimes:

One can interpret this pattern of behavior in a few ways. One is that Mueller is steadily putting in place the building blocks of a huge, mafia-style takedown that will end with Manafort flipping under pressure and new indictments coming against members of Donald Trumps family and damning evidence about Trump himself. Another would be that when placed under a microscope by an aggressive prosecutor, several Trump aides turn out to have been involved in financial malfeasance only loosely related to the Trump campaign and Trump himself did nothing wrong. But there is definitely evidence of crimes  including some serious ones  by a range of figures, some Russian and some Americans and some working at a very high level in Trumpworld.

Yet despite what most Americans perceive to be a very steady drumbeat of Trump-Russia news, the majority of the public is completely unaware of these critical facts.

That suggests that the press as a whole has not done a good job of actually conveying factual information to our audience, that Democrats messaging on the investigation has not been clear enough on the most damning point (Trump, even if otherwise innocent, is guilty of hiring crooks and trying to prevent an investigation into their activity), and that Trumps counterstrategy of muddying the waters around the investigation has been fairly successful.
