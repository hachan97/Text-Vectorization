New York Times columnist Frank Bruni expressed his alarm on Tuesday that special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into Russian meddling could actually be helping President Donald Trump.

The Mueller investigation, Bruni argued, is dominating media coverage to the extent its crowding out coverage of what Trump and his administration are actually doing.

Maybe the just-published Politico report of Trumps deliberate, cavalier use of a cellphone that doesnt have strict security safeguards would be getting extra attention if not for the Mueller investigation, Bruni pondered.

Without Mueller and Russia, Scott Pruitt would be closer to center stage, with an even brighter, harsher spotlight on him, the liberal columnist continued.
