Liberal activists are planning to lay in front of tanks if President Trump holds a military parade.

Activist Arn Menconi issued a call to action Tuesday asking for volunteers to block tanks, a la Tiananmen Square, in order to challenge Trumps Military Authoritarian State.

We now have nearly 50 Americans who have signed on to lay in front of the tanks of Trump brings out a military parade, Menconi announced on Twitter Wednesday, comparing the event to 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing where Chinese citizens protested the Communist governments brutal oppression.

We would go to Washington, D.C., if such a crazy and insane act occurred and we would lay down in front of the tanks, just like the heroes and the courageous students did in China in 1989, Merconi stated on Facebook.

Menconi, a 2016 Colorado Green party Senate candidate, says hes aware if hes arrested hell likely be charged with a felony.

In the next couple of days our voices need to be heard, he said. This isnt a misdemeanor. This would be a felony charge under Donald Trump. This would mean being thrown in jail, just like the students in China.

Other liberals on Twitter also melted down over the presidents proposal, predictably comparing him to Adolf Hitler.

While White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders did confirm Tuesday the president had asked the Pentagon to explore a celebration of the military for the American people, she said the administration is currently brainstorming but there are no current plans or a date set.
