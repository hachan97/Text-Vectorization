The New York Times is out with a bombshell story detailing how a) Vice President Mike Pence and his advisers are operating as a sort of de facto political unit within the White House and b) allies of President Donald Trump are none too happy about that fact.

"Republican officials now see Mr. Pence as seeking to exercise expansive control over a political party ostensibly helmed by Mr. Trump, tending to his own allies and interests even when the president's instincts lean in another direction. Even as he laces his public remarks with praise for the president, Mr. Pence and his influential chief of staff, Nick Ayers, are unsettling a group of Mr. Trump's fierce loyalists who fear they are forging a separate power base."

None of this should be all that surprising. Here's why:

Regardless of whether he should have seen it coming, you can bet Trump won't be happy to read the Times piece about Pence or, more accurately, to watch the cable news coverage about it. Trump doesn't like when anyone one-ups him or shows loyalty to anyone or anything but him. Politics abhors a vacuum. Trump's lack of ties to the GOP campaign establishment and his seeming disinterest in anyone's politics other than his own create an opening for Pence. The question is whether he can take advantage without seeming like he is taking advantage.
