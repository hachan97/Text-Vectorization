A Republican gubernatorial candidate for Georgia is bringing a Deportation Bus to the states sanctuary cities to tout his stance on deporting criminal illegal aliens.

A press release from state Sen. Michael Williams said the tour will expose how dangerous illegal aliens ruin local economies, cost American jobs, increase healthcare costs and lower education standards.

Williams also says in a newly-released campaign ad that hes going to send em home.

Its not going to be one of those pansy political bus tours. Weve got the Deportation Bus. Thats right, you heard me, he said.

Were gonna implement my 287(g) deportation plan thats gonna fill this bus with illegals to send em back to where they came from.

Were not just going to track them and watch them roam around our state. Were going to put them on this bus and send em home, he added.

President Trump on Tuesday called on Congress to secure the southern border during the annual Peace Officers Memorial Service.

We are calling on Congress to secure our borders, support our border agents, stop sanctuary cities and shut down policies that release violent criminals back into our communities, Trump said. We dont want it any longer. Weve had it. Enough is enough.
