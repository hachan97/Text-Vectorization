Anderson Cooper concluded his 60 Minutes interview with Stormy Daniels by suggesting that the president watches 60 Minutes. If hes watching tonight, what would you say to him? he asked Daniels.

Whether the president watched the news segment or not, on Monday morning Trump tweeted a more-cryptic-than-usual jab at fake news, saying it had never been more voluminous or inaccurate.

It certainly appears to be a subtweet of Stormy Danielss account of their 2006 affair and what she alleges were attempts and threats by those close to Trump to silence her. Daniels signed a nondisclosure agreement and accepted a $130,000 payment shortly before the election, a deal she told Cooper she accepted because she was concerned for my family and their safety.

Trump has, notably, not directly addressed the scandal or Danielss lawsuit publicly, on Twitter or anywhere else. The White House, through press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, has both denied the affair and that the president had anything to do with the $130,000 hush money payment.

Chris Ruddy, CEO of Newsmax and a friend of Trump, did tell ABC News This Week that Trump considered the Daniels story a political hoax.

You know, at the bottom line, theres just never been a claim of harassment, Ruddy said. So the president looks at this and I think hes looking at it like Im looking at it. This is politically motivated to hurt and embarrass him in some way.

Trumps tweet on Monday morning is the closest hes come to trying to discredit Danielss account himself  but he stopped short of naming her or attacking her story directly.
