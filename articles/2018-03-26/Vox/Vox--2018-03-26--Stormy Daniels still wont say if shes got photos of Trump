Does Stormy Daniels have photos to back up her story of an affair with Donald Trump?

Thats one question she didnt answer during her 60 Minutes interview with Anderson Cooper on Sunday night.

The nondisclosure agreement she signed in October 2016 required her to turn over any video images, still images, email messages, and text messages of Trump, leading some to speculate about whether she in fact has such documentary evidence. Danielss lawyer, Michael Avenatti, has been hinting that she does, tweeting a photo of a CD on Thursday along with the message, If a picture is worth a thousand words, how many words is this worth?????

On Sunday, however, she would not answer Cooper when he asked about the existence of photos or other evidence. My attorney has recommended that I dont discuss those things.

Cooper also asked Avenatti about the existence of photos, noting that Avenatti might simply be bluffing.

You should ask some of the other people in my career when theyve bet on me bluffing, Avenatti replied.

But he didnt offer any more details about any possible evidence.

Earlier on Sunday, Avenatti tweeted that he and Daniels had material they wouldnt be sharing on 60 Minutes:

Theres been a degree of showmanship in Avenattis approach to the Daniels case and its possible hes holding the American people  and the president  in suspense. Its also possible that there are no photos.

Ultimately, though, that may not matter. Whether or not Daniels can prove she had sex with Trump, theres no doubt that she was paid $130,000 not to talk about having sex with Trump. And what matters now is whether that was an illegal campaign contribution  and whether Daniels was bullied or threatened into silence by Trumps associates, as she claimed on Sunday.

As Avenatti told Cooper, This is about the cover-up.
