Former President Barack Obama told attendees at a conference in Japan on Sunday that he is looking to shape a million young leaders in his image to help the human race.

If I could do that effectively, thenyou knowI would create a hundred or a thousand or a million young Barack Obamas or Michelle Obamas, Obama told the attendees. Or, the next group of people who could take that baton in that relay race that is human progress.

Obama reportedly made the remarks while discussing the Obama Foundations efforts to help young people around the world get connected to each other via the Internet.

The former president said that todays problems are mostly caused by old men, and young people such as the organizers of the anti-gun March for Our Lives rally who survived the high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, can create change to solve those problems.
