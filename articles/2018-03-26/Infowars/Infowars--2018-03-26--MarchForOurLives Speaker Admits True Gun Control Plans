Ok, #MarchForOurLives supporters. Take a knee. We need to talk. Far be it from me to tell you how to take away our constitutional rights. I know you guys want us to believe that this is really about gun safety and not gun control. Even though the facts on the ground say otherwise (see Top 5 Idiotic Moments From March for Our Lives Gun Control Rally and Video: Anti-Gun Marchers Cant Answer Basic Firearm Questions). You want us to believe you dont really hate gun owners.

If thats the case, you may want to stop saying things like this in public:

That is literally  and this is an appropriate use of the word here  the exact reason why gun rights advocates refuse to back down. Word for word. The left calls pro-gunners paranoid for thinking Big Brother is going to go door-to-door swiping gats. Then, in the next sentence, they confirm their intention of doing that very thing. These kiddos and #MarchForOurLives are a gift that just refuses to stop giving.

This young lady just accidentally completed Second Amendment peeps work. We no longer need to make our case, she was kind enough to do it for us. To that, we can only say thank you.

Even non-gunners feel the same way. Theyre just not quite as happy about it:

Uh, thats because the NRAs rhetoric, also known as the United States Constitution, isreasonable compared to grab-em-all leftists. This one video clip makes our argument against gun control better than we ever could. For years to come, when pro-gunners invoke the slippery slope, they need only to cite this lass.

Its going to be hard to label us as paranoid gun nuts when you confirm the paranoia.
