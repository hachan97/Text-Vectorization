President Trumps approval numbers went up during the weekend CBS ran a 60 Minutes Stormy Daniels tell-all interview, according to CNNs own poll.

The poll, conducted between March 22-25, showed that 42% approved of Trumps performance as president, up from 7 points since last month.

During the same period the poll was conducted, the mainstream media was in high gear with the porn stars claims that she had a one-time affair with the president in 2006.

Its worth noting that these results come from CNNs own polling.

As we reported, nobody cares about the Stormy Daniels story except for the corporate media, who failed to take down Trump with the bogus Russia collusion narrative, the obstruction of justice narrative, and the suggestion that Trump is mentally unfit to serve.

But CNNs poll doesnt reflect that. Instead, it reflects the Stormy Daniels story could have actually improved Trumps rating!

Thats likely because most people dont find consensual sex between a beautiful woman and a notorious billionaire playboy all that shocking, or relevant to Trumps current role as President of the United States.

CNN even admitted that Trumps highest numbers came from his America First economic platform  probably because thats what middle America actually cares about.

The Presidents strongest approval ratings on the issues come on the economy, the only issue tested where his reviews tilt more positive than negative: 48% approve and 45% disapprove, CNN reported Monday.
