As MSNBC reported on air strikes being launched against Syrian targets Friday night, anchor Brian Williams made a big blunder: He called President Trump President Obama.

It all started 9 oclock eastern time, Williams dramatically announced, with about a five minute address by President Obama. Heres a portion of that, he said, cutting to Trumps speech.

Its ironic Williams mistakenly invoked the Nobel Peace Prize winner-turned-warmonger while announcing the bombing.
