During this weeks Saturday Night Live cold open, actor Robert De Niro played the role of special counsel Bob Mueller conducting a lie detector test with President Trump attorney Michael Cohen, played by De Niros former Meet the Fockers and Little Fockers co-star, Ben Stiller.

Stillers Cohen was worried about the evidence the FBI would find, saying, You know how much evidence I have in my office? Im Donald Trumps lawyer. I have an entire hard drive thats just labeled yikes!

One of the questions Mueller asked Cohen for the lie detector test was how he liked that pee-pee tape.
