Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich ripped the office of special counsel Robert Mueller in an interview on Sunday, calling the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia a breakdown of the U.S. Constitution.

In an interview with AM 970 The Answer, the top Trump supporter pointed to former Secretary of State Hillary Clintons email investigation as evidence of a double standard that Gingrich says Americans are sick of seeing.

Whats really striking to me is, you have Hillary Clinton erase 33,000 emails. You have her staff deeply involved. Do any of them get visited at 3 in the morning? Do any of them lose their lawyer-client privilege? No. It is so one-sided, Gingrich said, referring to the FBIs recent raid on the offices of Trumps personal attorney, Michael Cohen, who is the subject of a criminal probe.

This is why we have a bill of rights, Gingrich added. I think what were watching is a breakdown of the whole concept of constitutional rule of law. I think its really very sobering, and a real threat to every American.
