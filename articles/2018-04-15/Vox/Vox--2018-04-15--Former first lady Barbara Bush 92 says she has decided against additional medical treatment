Former first lady Barbara Bush, 92, has decided not to seek additional medical treatment and will focus on comfort care following a series of recent hospitalizations, according to a statement from the office of former President George H.W. Bush on Sunday. It will not surprise those who know her that Barbara Bush has been a rock in the face of her failing health, worrying not for herself  thanks to her abiding faith  but for others, the statement reads. She is surrounded by a family she adores, and appreciates the many kind messages and especially the prayers she is receiving.

A close aide to the family told CNN that Bush is in failing health and has been suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, and congestive heart failure, for quite some time.

Barbara and George H.W. Bush have been married for 73 years and are the parents of former President George W. Bush and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.

News of Bushs bad health prompted an outpouring of support.
