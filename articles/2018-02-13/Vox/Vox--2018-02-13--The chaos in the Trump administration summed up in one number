It sure feels like the Trump administration is in utter chaos.

Last week, White House staff secretary Robert Porter resigned after both of his ex-wives said publicly that he abused them. We also learned that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly seemingly knew about the alleged abuse and covered it up  and he too may be resigning as a result. Meanwhile, Rachel Brand, the third-ranking official at the Department of Justice, also stepped down  for fear that she would have to manage the Russia probe if her superior, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, were to quit or be fired.

None of this is normal. But theres a statistic from a Tuesday piece by the New York Timess Peter Baker that really puts it in perspective.

Baker used data from the Brookings Institution that calculated the staff turnover rate in President Trumps White House  roughly 34 percent. He then compared this to Brookings data on previous administrations, finding that Trumps was higher than any White House in decades.

This, if anything, understates the case. To quote Baker:

Trumps 34 percent turnover rate in his first year is more than three times as high as President Barack Obamas in the same period and twice as high as President Ronald Reagans, which until now was the modern record-holder. Of 12 positions deemed most central to the president, only five are still filled by the same person as when Mr. Trump took office.

A key part of Trumps argument during the 2016 campaign was that he was an excellent manager, someone who would hire the best people and use his business acumen to fix Washington. This was always a dubious theory  Trumps businesses werent actually that successful  but now weve had a year to test it and see if he really could run a tight White House.

So far, Trumps record on that score isnt just bad: Its historically bad.
