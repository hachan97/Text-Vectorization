President Donald Trump on Friday promoted the House Intelligence Committee's findings on Russian meddling in the 2016 election as a way to vindicate himself from the investigation into potential collusion between his campaign and Russia.

"House Intelligence Committee votes to release final report. FINDINGS: (1) No evidence provided of Collusion between Trump Campaign & Russia. (2) The Obama Administrations Post election response was insufficient. (3) Clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts," Trump wrote on Twitter

Democrats on the committee, however, rejected the report and accused their Republican colleagues of failing to conduct a proper investigation.

While Republicans say Thursday's vote marks the end of the House Intelligence Committee's probe, Democrats plan on pushing forward with their own investigation.
