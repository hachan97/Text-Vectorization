Time in Trumpworld seems to slow as huge news story after huge news story forms, crests, crashes and recedes -- only to be followed by an even bigger one right on its heels.

Every Friday on the Point, I run through ALL of the major headlines of the week -- just so you can remember (and I can remember) exactly what happened.

This week set a record (President Trump will be happy to hear that!) with 29 major headlines. 29! They're broken down below by day (thank you, Brenna Williams !).
