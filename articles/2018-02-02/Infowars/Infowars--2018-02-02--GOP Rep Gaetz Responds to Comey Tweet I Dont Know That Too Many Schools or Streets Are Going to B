Thursday on Fox News Channels The Story, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) dismissed claims that a much-anticipated House Intelligence Committee-generated memo was altered in a way that would distort the information misleadingly.

According to Gaetz, the changes were grammatical.

Gaetz also reacted to a tweet from former FBI Director James Comey invoking former Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-WI), an outspoken opponent of possible communist infiltration of the U.S. government.

I would remind Director Comey: I dont know that too many schools or streets are going to be named after him once this memo is into the public square, Gaetz added.
