Donald Trump has lashed out at the leadership and investigators at the FBI and the Justice Department, saying that they politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans.

The US president attacked both authorities on Twitter by saying that their political bias is something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago.

Trumps accusations come just as the White House is expected released a secret memo alleging FBI bias against the US president. On Monday night, the House Intelligence Committee approved the public release of the memo.

The FBI has objected to the memos release, expressing grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memos accuracy. The bureau said it had been given only a limited opportunity to review the memo before the committee voted to release it.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, who commissioned the memo, described objections from the FBI and the Department of Justice to the papers release as spurious.

Having stonewalled Congress demands for information for nearly a year, its no surprise to see the FBI and DOJ issue spurious objections to allowing the American people to see information related to surveillance abuses at these agencies, Nunes said earlier this week.
