Attorney General Jeff Sessions told Fox News Shannon Bream Wednesday that he will consider naming a second special counsel to probe the FBI and Justice Departments investigations into possible collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia.

Well, I have great respect for Mr. Gowdy and Chairman Goodlatte, and we are going to consider seriously their recommendations, Sessions told Bream in an interview that ran late Wednesday night. I have appointed a person outside of Washington  many years at the Department of Justice  to look at all of the allegations that the House Judiciary Committee members sent to us and we are conducting that investigation.

He also stated he is well aware that we have a responsibility to ensure the integrity of the FISA process.

We are not afraid to look at that, the former Alabama senator explained. The inspector general, something that our inspector general is not very strong, but he has almost 500 employees, most of which are lawyers and prosecutors, and they are looking at the FISA process.
