CNNs latest obsession in its ongoing anti-Trump obstruction agenda is the publicity stunt lawsuit pulled by porn star Stormy Daniels, who claims Trump paid her to keep quiet about an affair.

While many Americans are focusing on matters of the economy, immigration, and geopolitics, CNN, again acting like a jilted ex-lover, has soloed in on the fakest of fake news.

Operating more like the National Enquirer than a legitimate news organization, practically every CNN reporter has penned a piece or hosted a segment about the Stormy Daniels case in the past 24 hours.

Chris Cuomo, Alisyn Camerota and Van Jones presented a segment in which they asked what would have happened to Obama, had the same allegations been made against him:

I said many times, if Barack Obama had done just half of what Trump did last week, he would have been impeached, he would be in Guantanamo. Van Jones ludicrously claimed.

Jones also declared that the press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders is tap dancing on marbles and stated that at some point youre going to slip.

At a press briefing Wednesday, CNN reporter Jeff Zeleny asked FIVE questions about Stormy Daniels, which Sanders did her best to ignore, and instead focus on real news, stating Trump already won the case.

Sanders response triggered CNNs Jim Acosta into claiming that Trump is upset with the press secretary. Acosta cited those mysterious anonymous sources in his report. In other words, fake sources.

How long will Americans put up with CNNs fake news based purely on vendettas?
