Former Trump attorney Michael Cohen contended Friday evening via Twitter that his meeting with comedian Tom Arnold on Thursday was just a chance, public encounter in the hotel lobby where Arnold had asked him for a selfie.

Thursday evening, Arnold tweeted a picture of himself and Cohen with the caption, I love New York. He then implied to NBC News that his meeting with Cohen had to do with a show he is working on with Vice about the search for incriminating video footage of President Trump.

This dude has all the tapes  this dude has everything, Arnold said. I say to Michael, Guess what? Were taking Trump down together, and hes so tired hes like, OK, and his wife is like, OK, f Trump.
