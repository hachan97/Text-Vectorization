The National Sheriffs Association Executive Director and CEO Jonathan Thompson says that, by alerting criminals that there would be a law enforcement operation in her area, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf put both citizens and police in danger.

This is just another example of a California politician playing politics with the safety of the community, Thompson said Wednesday in a statement condemning Schaafs dangerous and reckless politics, which gave safe harbor to known criminals:

What the Mayor is doing is dangerous and reckless. By alerting the public of the operation, she gave known criminal illegals safe harbor which ultimately put the people in that area, as well as law enforcement, in danger.
