Earlier this week, a coalition of 20 states filed a lawsuit claiming Obamacare is unconstitutional. Voxs Sarah Kliff says thats just the latest pushback on the Affordable Care Act. Idaho has been quietly allowing insurance plans that dont comply with Obamacares rules, and the Trump administration hasnt been doing anything to stop it.

Experts say if the federal government doesnt intervene, other red states will likely follow in Idahos footsteps. Kliff elaborates in the latest episode of Today, Explained:

The decision of where you buy health insurance actually affects others. It can harm other people. So in Idaho, the situation that health experts worry about is that the really healthy and younger people who have low health costs, theyre going to gravitate toward these anti-Obamacare plans. Because they dont have preexisting conditions, they can get a better deal there. And theyll say, Great. Im out of the Obamacare market. The sick and the older people are going to be left behind in the Obamacare market, and they will likely face higher premiums as a result. ... Its not about individual liberty; it also has much wider ripple effects for anyone who buys their own health insurance in Idaho.
