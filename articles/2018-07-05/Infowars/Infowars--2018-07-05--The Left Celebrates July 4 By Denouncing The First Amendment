The biggest news this week is that the Left has officially turned against the First Amendment and freedom of speech  and just in time for the Fourth of July!

If youre on the Right, it is not news that the Left wants to shut us up. The only change is that this goal is being announced openly in the leading publications of the mainstream Left, specifically in a long article in The New York Times warning about How Conservatives Weaponized the First Amendment. Weaponized. Thats right, theyre giving the First Amendment the same treatment they gave the Second. Does free speech seem as scary and dangerous as an AR-15 yet?

So whats wrong with the First Amendment? It protects people the Left doesnt like. No, really, thats the argument.

On the final day of the Supreme Court term last week, Justice Elena Kagan sounded an alarm. The courts five conservative members, citing the First Amendment, had just dealt public [employees] unions a devastating blow. The day before, the same majority had used the First Amendment to reject a California law requiring religiously oriented crisis pregnancy centers to provide women with information about abortion. Conservatives, said Justice Kagan, who is part of the courts four-member liberal wing, were weaponizing the First Amendment.
